0,2.0,Dirty Room,"Stayed at the Bellagio for the first time ever for a work trip. I had requested early check-in via front desk chat on Hotels.com and was not told I had to fill out anything in advance on the App to secure. They found me an accessible room, which was good until I entered the room. I found a used razor blade on the bathroom counter, the towels were used with stains on them, and there was hair throughout the bathroom and in between the bed sheets."
1,5.0,Great vacation!!,Beautiful well kept room with a great view. Wonderful food and great staff!! This is a beautiful hotel that has everything you need for a wonderful vacation. We did most of our gambling and most of our dining at the Bellagio.
2,4.0,Fantastic Experience at Bellagio,"We had a wonderful time at Bellagio. Everything from the room (with spectacular view), food, pool, casino, and shopping were top notch! The only little thing was we had paid for early check in and still had to wait until nearly 3:00 for our room to be ready. They did end up waiving the fee but after a long morning of travel we would have preferred to pay the fee and get in the room sooner teat up and recharge:) Can’t wait to come back, and maybe next time book a later flight."
3,4.0,Beautiful but $22 for water?,"I had a great stay at the Bellagio. The place is gorgeous, over the top in every way, the restaurants were all fantastic. My issue boils down to when you just want a quick bite or a drink of water without having to wander the casino looking for a place. $40 for a salad with 4 shrimp and a soda water seems a tad bit high to me. $8.30 for an iced tea. None of these items came with presentations or anything exotic that warranted the severe over charge. If you want water late at night and didn't plan ahead, watch out for the Fiji in your room! It'll cost you!"
4,5.0,A perfect Weekend getaway!,The hotel is wheelchair friendly. The rooms were clean no odor. Check in and out was easy and fast. The spa was GREAT the best 24/7 room service FAST. The view was great. The services were on time. I love the safety of catching a cab

7,1.0,AC stopped working on our last day,"AC stopped working on our last day. We thought it’ll start working throughout the day. After a tiring day we returned to our room at 1am in the morning, AC still not working! We called guest service, we were advised that an engineer will come to fix it but we got an electric fan instead ! We called again to follow up on the engineer, he came after an hour of our first call. We were told that the motor broke and he doesn’t have a replacement motor, they run out !!! Although we were moved to another room on same floor, we would’ve appreciated not having to go through this dissapointing experience especially our flight is at 730am!"
8,5.0,Bellagio delivered,"We went to retake a family picture taken 20 years ago. Bellagio was the perfect place to do this. The rooms were immaculate (we had 3), the food was great and just the environment make for an enjoyable stay! Going back in a couple months."
9,3.0,10 Year Anniversary Trip,"My husband and I, with a group of friends, came to Vegas to celebrate our 10th anniversary. I explained to the concierge, Victor, that it was very important for me to have a wedding cake made for my anniversary because the Mandalay Bay forgot to make the cake for the wedding ten years ago. My husband and I made a big deal for our tenth anniversary. I bought a new wedding dress my husband bought a new suite and we were ready to make new memories. I talked with Victor and emailed with Victor many times to make sure I would have my cake. I completed my cake form and included a picture of the cake I wanted. Victor said he would need to check with the pastry chef to see if he would make the cake. Victor emailed me to confirm that the pastry chef would make the cake but wasn't"
10,3.0,The sell out,MGM Rewards has gone the way of being well it SUCKS Tight with all slot play going the way the Bean counters want. There is no real easy give back to the Players Club Members. So bring your wallet because it will cost you to eat.
11,4.0,Ballagio Spa Tower,"Room was dated, would recommend looking into an upgrading. Room felt a bit like a budget vegas hotel. Over all staff was nice however, most of the security elevator area staff was not the friendliest."
12,5.0,Absolutely fantastic,"We stayed at the Bellagio for 3 nights as we were getting married in Vegas. Everything from start to finish was exceptional. The staff are so knowledgeable, friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble. The room was immaculate and spotlessly clean, the views were fantastic and the floral garden was breathtaking. We visited the other hotels while we were there and although they are all different, the Bellagio just had that old school glamour. We will be back!!"
13,5.0,AWESOME!!!!,"We had an amazing Easter Holiday Trip. The AMBIANCE of this luxury resort was FABULOUS!!! Also, it's exactly where you have easily access to all luxury stores and Casino. You can spend the day in the pools and Atrium, so relaxing and beautiful."

24,5.0,Bellagio is what Vegas is all about.,My favorite place to stay in Vegas. Great places to eat and the lobby piano bar is the best place to people watch. We have stayed at the zbellsgio for the past six or seven years. It remains the best by seeing to every detail.

30,5.0,Simply The Best,"My wife and I have been going to Vegas annually for over 15 years ---and we've stayed in most of the city's major hotels.

31,5.0,45th Anniversary,Beautiful place Clean newly remodeled room It was Easter weekend so the garden was decorated for spring. So pretty. We had breakfast in bed on the morning we left.

32,5.0,Bellagio still the best,"Room was great with good space, view and an A/C you can actually crank way down; terrific food options; location on strip can’t be beat. Casino is very clean with good filtration system which is big to us as non smokers. O show still best on the strip."
33,5.0,Where to go in Vegas,"Belliagio is truly THE best!! They treat you like royalty! Please check this hotel/casino out! I guarantee you won’t be disappointed. Rooms are excellent, casino is fantastic, and there isn’t a bad restaurant in the whole place!!"
34,5.0,Love the Bellagio!,"Check in was a breeze. Stayed in a Bellagio Queen Suite on the 36th floor and everything was wonderful. The room was clean, air conditioning worked great, beds were very comfortable and room service was delivered fairly quickly. Reviews were showing complaints about no housekeeping services but we opted for the ""do not disturb"" sign for our four night stay. You have to be pretty lazy not to make up your own bed for a few days and how much room trash could you accumulate if you are out all day? We saw housekeeping in the hall every day in the event we needed anything. Spent lots of time in the casino which was pretty smokey and we had no problem getting drinks as there were cocktail waitresses all over the place. While we didn't win any big jackpots we didn't lose"
35,5.0,VIP Service,We had an issue when checking into the Penthouse suite but Jacqueline was so kind to correct the issue. She made our stay so much more pleasant! All around the Bellagio is top notch! Great customer service!

39,5.0,Great to be back at Bellagio,Wonderful stay! We have stayed at Bellagio many times and enjoyed this visit the best. Our Bellagio strip view suite on the 31st floor of the spa tower was the best suite we have stayed in. It was extremely quiet and was a great set of rooms. We really liked the mobile check in and communication. Our room was cleaned daily while we were out. The Bellagio is ideally located with easy access to many restaurants and casinos. We look forward to our next visit.
40,5.0,Spectacular as always.,"Trip was wonderful. Dined at Le Cirque and all I can say is wow. Staff were helpful as always, gambling was fun, and the room was immaculate. Only hiccup was one morning there was a very drunk individual yelling cocktail, cocktail, cocktail which staff did nothing about I assume because he was hemorrhaging 100 dollar bills into the slots. It was amusing at first, but after an hour it got really annoying. Worst part is no servers showed up in that area - I assume so no had to officially cut him off. Had to finally go to the gift shop and buy a water. This was at 7:00 am. As annoyed as I was at the time - it does make for a good story."
41,5.0,Wonderful place to stay,Very nice place to stay in Vegas.. Great location and awesome staff!!! We really enjoyed the central location and the restaurants were incredible.. We will definitely be making another visit to the Bellagio!!!
42,3.0,Bellagio Review,"Very nice property with great location. Beautiful facility with great staff. The room we were assigned was very tired needs major upgrades. No water pressure, very little hot water and it took 5+ minutes of running to get warm water, shower stall glass walls leaks with mold in corners, bed worn on both outside sides. middle of the bed seemed fine. However, for the cost of the room I have had much better room at Hampton Inn for $100."
43,5.0,Good Stuff,"Staff was very friendly upon checking in. Room was excellent with a good view of the strip. Pools were heated, had whirlpools as well. Lots of food options for all types of ages. Will stay here again in the near future."
44,4.0,Anniversary trip,"Wonderful trip! Awesome food and drinks! The pool area was a little short staffed, but the workers that were there - were awesome and working very hard to help everyone. There should be more coffee options in the hotel considering everyone is hungover :) and a bench here and there - for those that need to rest throughout the hotel/casino, would be helpful! But we Would definitely stay at the Bellagio again. Overall it was great!"
45,5.0,LOVE the Bellagio and the location,"We stayed at the Bellagio during the NFL draft and despite all the people in and around the Bellagio, we never had to wait on tables or in crazy long lines for taxis. They were prepared and had ample staff and it made for a great experience. It was so clean and the staff was friendly and we loved being so centrally located. It was a great stay. No complaints!"
46,5.0,Draft Fun,My husband and I went to Vegas for a quick trip. We didn't realize the NFL draft was taking place. We thought it would be packed and crazy but it wasn't. We had a great time walking around and seeing all the pre draft set up. Bellagio was a great location for us. The staff were all friendly and rooms were clean and comfortable
47,5.0,As advertised,"We've all heard how nice Bellagio is. It's true...also huge, noisy, crowded...you know...Las Vegas. We got an ""upgraded"" king room. It was just another king room, nothing special. View of the highway. We're not gamblers, so can't comment on that. Fun people-watching though. Fountain was cool. Nothing negative to say about the place."
48,4.0,Vacation,"Hotel was beautiful. Great Location. Pool and Hot Tub was only opened until 6:00 - Wish it stayed open longer. Lots of shopping places, slots and tables. The only thing I wish they would have had a few more small eating places."
49,5.0,40th Birthday,"I love staying at the Bellagio. It’s beautiful, the majority of the staff are WONDERFUL! If you like to play craps, Carl will make sure you have fun! The conservatory is always beautiful and worth the stay right there!"
50,5.0,Bellagio Resort,"Excellent Hotel. Great Restaurants, Slots, table games and rooms. Easy access to the strip. Employees very professional and courteous. Have stayed at Bellagio for many years, would not stay anywhere else."
51,5.0,Doesn't get any better!,"There aren't many hotels that do it as well as the Bellagio. The staff is very welcoming, the Check-in process is seamless, and the food is top-notch. There's a reason that Bellagio consistently makes the 5-star rating."
52,5.0,Great hotel,Loved the hotel. The only thing that I would change is to have at least one deep pool and also wish they prolong the hours of operation for the buffet or reopen for dinner time. Great location and great staff.
53,5.0,NFL Draft weekend Extrsvaganza,Great weekend thanks to the team @ the Bellagio! Everything went so smoothly on a busy draft weekend. Beautiful facilities and great team members. Don’t miss the Piano Bsr near the Hotel lobb. Great live music and great drinks and atmosphere.
54,5.0,We love everything about the Bellagio,We have been staying at the Bellagio a few times and each time our interactions with staff have all been amazing. Our room is always comfortable and clean. We love Yellowtail restaurant and eat there each time. The pool restaurant has gluten free buns and options and is always yummy. And the pool area is the best. It's always clean and the service is amazing. We pick Bellagio over the other restaurants we stayed at.
55,3.0,Not the best experience everyone in the casino wasn’t the friendliest.,"We received great customer service at the restaurant Snacks. Very friendly, fast and decent food. GREAT CHEESECAKE ! The pools were also an experience in itself so many pool and jacuzzis that crowding is unlikely. :)"
56,4.0,Great service,The employees at the Bellagio take pride in providing exceptional service. The cleaning staff to the casino floor employees provided great service with a smile and helped creat a perfect weekend getaway for the family.
57,5.0,Lisa W. in the News Stand,We had a wonderful experience and service when we visited the news stand inside of the Bellagio to pick up a few drinks before heading out to the NFL Draft. Lisa W. remembered us and our favorite NFL team (Washington Commanders). She was so friendly and kind! We hope to see her again during our next visit!
58,1.0,Is it really clean?,"For almost $500 a night, I was expecting a clean room. I am now doubting that when I saw a bunch of hair in the shower. I didn’t call the desk anymore because it was late and I was tired. The staff were friendly though. That part is good."
59,5.0,Love this Hotel and the Fountain,"Great hotel great ambiance, and great restaurant and food selections. I am disappointed the all night breakfast restaurant is closed and replaced with less popular restaurant bar. Always a great time at the Bellagio"
60,4.0,Review,"I found the room and bathroom lovely. The restaurant choices are good, the Spa GREAT. I had a bit of a snafu checkin in. I like staying here and will again in the future. Wish you had a coffee machine in the room"
61,3.0,Unsatisfactory stay,"Property was amazing, customer service very friendly just wish your housekeeping were more cautious about marking a clean room CLEAN when it wasn’t, I would of rather waited an extra hour to have a clean room than having to deal with this let alone my wife hates to complain."
62,5.0,Anniversary Celebration,My wife and I celebrated our 25th year anniversary. We could not have picked a better place to stay. We rented a room with the fountain view. It was a very nice anniversary get away. We will definitely be returning to the Bellagio!
63,4.0,That’s Amore,"Great weekend getaway from the Westcoast. Wonderful to have warm weather. Pool opens at 9am. If you want to get a seat during the hot months of Vegas, I suggest you haul yourself down. If you snooze ..you lose! Poolside service is available for both food and beverages. QR Codes are also attached to the bottom of your chair if cannot wait for a server to come by."
64,4.0,Sin,"Except noise of a scissor lift sort of equipment at 3 am in the morning at the parking lot area, cleaning or fixing something should have been considered. I was at the 16th floor and couldn't sleep thru the night, can't imagine the lower floor rooms."
65,5.0,Made our first time in Vegas a wonderful experience!,"Loved our stay at the Bellagio! We stayed in the room with a slightly bigger bathroom since it has a separate tub, and we enjoyed all the window views from our room. Romantic atmosphere at night and a wonderful room to come back to after walking around in the hot Las Vegas weather!"
66,5.0,bellagio the beautiful... love everything about the Bellagio! Can not wait to come back to stay here!,"belllagio the beautiful! Love everthing about the Bellagio, the food, the service, the grounds, the flowes the shopping the pool... all above excellent! cant wait to come back! My favorite resort in Las Vegas!"
67,4.0,Best on the strip,"This is a wonderful hotel and has more class than the others. The environment is great, the garden is amazing, and the rooms are very nice. You get what you pay for, and some of the really simple things are a bit over-the-top pricy. I wouldn't stay anywhere else."
68,5.0,fabulous pool destination,"great pools, and plan to eat at the pools, restaurants,or elsewhere. avoid in room dining for now. it used to be wonderful but clearly this is where cost saving is occurring at the moment. comfortable rooms, very nice casino. Our favorite place to stay n Vegas"
69,5.0,Stay Well Rooms,The stay well rooms are so elegant and so clean it’s a relaxing place to stay. The spacious room with such great details it was the best place to stay no doubt. I was glad my daughter loved it since we were there to celebrate her 28th Birthday
70,5.0,Amazing!,"As always, Bellagio impressed from when I got out the car with valet, to checking in, to the room, dinner reservations, gaming, fountain, and everything. I’d stay here every time if I could. It’s an amazing property and the best on the strip! And I visit the strip often!"
71,3.0,Has Potential for better,Customer Service; Customer Service; Customer Service! I don't exactly know what happened to this Hotel and the people who work here but it's nothing like it used to be. It's apparent that all that the establishment cares about is MONEY!
72,3.0,Good- but showing it's age and attention to detail is being missed.,"Room was very dated. Multiple lightbulbs out, dust on fixtures, and door handles look like it hadn't been wiped down in months. A/C didn't get room below 70° (and yes the curtains were closed). 2 housekeeping call requests for more towels on separate days werent delivered. Chunks of wood from the furniture missing. Now the good: vallet for bags were on it! Superhelpful at checkout also getting down to the ride-sharing area. The gardens were stunning. Pool staff was great (pool was slammed too). Fountains are always a nice display."
73,5.0,Classy,"We stayed from April 29 thru May 1st 2022, Hotel Rooms are renovated and looks new, clean and roomy. Everywhere we went on the property was clean and updated. Lots of Restaurant's and entertainment options."
74,3.0,DONT GAMBLE HERE,"Pit boss Ruby is rude, condescending, and judgmental. I gamble thousands of dollars regularly when I travel to Vegas. she ruined my gambling experience at the tables. I will never gamble at this casino again."
75,3.0,"No coffee in the rooms! What a racket, you get coffee in your room at a Days Inn. Other than that rooms were very nice",No coffee in the rooms what a racket you can get coffee in your room at a Days Inn. Otherwise the rooms were very nice and clean and service was as expected. They do have very high security which is a good thing!
76,4.0,Nice Hotel,"Overall, we had a nice stay. The rooms are good and staff is friendly. It was easy to get to the Las Vegas Strip. The conservatory was gorgeous! The flowers inside the hotel are very fragrant and look like great deal of care put into upkeep of the flowers. Room service food is yummy."
77,3.0,No sleep in the suites,We love this place. But the thumping in the suites is unjustified for the price we pay. Club music until 3 am. We are not rested. We are coming back frustrated. We love this resort. We will reach out to management to remedy and see what happens.
78,5.0,Why Spend a bit more in Vegas,"Yes the school of thought is save money on rooms. But just for the customer service the little extra goes a long way. I was able because of the MGM app to early check-in, get my parking pass, and go from the freeway to my room."
79,5.0,Best Hotel in Vegas,"Another great stay at Bellagio, beautiful, clean and friendly. They do an excellent job on keeping their standards high. The Conservatory is a real gem and always the first place we go to. Bellagio's location makes it the heart of Las Vegas."
80,5.0,Still one of the best MGM properties,"Great location. Wonderful staff who are very professional, knowledgeable, and customer-oriented. Good room and many good food options. While the food options were good they were very expensive...most likely in the same range of the other good restaurants on the strip."
81,5.0,Always Lovely!,"I always stay at the Bellagio! Beautiful, wonderful staff, great rewards, pool/cabanas and great restaurants! We had a fantastic view of the pools and could we could see our cabana, lol. I can’t wait to go again ❤️"
82,5.0,Beautiful Hotel in the middle of the strip,"My daughter's and I stayed here when we came to see Lady Gaga. Our flight was delayed, so we were in a time crunch. The bell clerk took our luggage from the taxi and we were back on our way in 2 minutes. I love the remote check in and the keyless entry, but it backfired on me this time because my phone battery died as I approached the elevator. The elevator attendant called security so I could be let into my room. This happened with hardly any wait time at all. The bell clerk had our luggage up to our room in less than 5 minutes after we called for it. After a soak in the giant bathtub and a night in the gloriously comfortable bed I was ready to take on another day. They have a kiosk near hotel check in where you can print your own key. I printed a key for each of"
83,5.0,Bellagio is the Best in Vegas!!,"We loved Bellagio!! Beautiful and very clean throughout the property!! We received early check in and late check out complimentary!! I’m a MGM Gold Rewards member and my resort fees were waived. Dinner at Yellowtail is a must!! Lago has great cocktails and wine, but the food was okay at best… very small servings. Sadelle’s for breakfast was a 10, we loved the whole experience!! Luc the manager is the best in the business, and he always makes us feel special. The beds and bedding are very comfortable and the newer rooms felt like a boutique hotel with a very large shower!! Loved our views of the pool area and mountains!! The pools are heated and we loved the large jacuzzi’s. We ate at the Pool Cafe for breakfast and loved the food and service. The Gelato Cafe was good for coffee,"
84,5.0,Exquisite Stay at the Bellagio,I was invited by a friend who attended the PSCU marketing conference. This was the first time in Vegas for me and a great pleasure to get to stay at this hotel casino. Everything was clean and everyone went above and beyond to help. Much appreciated. I will certainly stay here again and recommend it to colleagues. Thanks again!
85,5.0,Treat Yourself!,"Who would have thought that Vegas and relax could go together?!?!? I had the most exceptional time dining, relaxing , and living my best life! Everyone at Bellagio from the front desk to the pool waitstaff were friendly and helpful! You know it’s truly a get away when the staff can anticipate guest’s needs and do the math for you for your drink orders! That is truly a vacation: relax and leave your worries for a few days! I feel rejuvenated from this trip! I’m booking my next stay soon and you all should too!"
86,3.0,Rooms do not adequately keep outside sound out.,"Very disappointed with the amount of noise coming into the rooms from the outside. Do not recommend the fountain view rooms. Had no idea that the NFL draft was happening at our hotel during our stay except the 4 day advance email. Complaints were handled with a will make amends, but never were."
87,1.0,Disappointing trip to Vegas,This was my first trip the Vegas and I’m quite surprised that a Hotel of this magnitude could have such disappointing rooms as well as service. The rooms are old and there were so many things wrong with them. I don’t think I’ll ever come back. They could do so much better.
88,5.0,"Lovely Hotel, Fantastic Restaurants",Room was very comfortable with tasteful decor. Checkin and checkout was quick and all staff we dealt with were polite and helpful.Saved the best for last - had a fantastic dinner at Picasso! Food and service were exceptional and we were lucky to have an outdoor table facing the fountains. What a memorable evening!
89,5.0,Most Beautiful Hotel in Las Vegas!,The hotel is very beautiful and spectacular! The rooms look also very good with the touches of gold color which makes it more modern and luxurious. It is definitely one of the best hotels in Las Vegas!
90,5.0,Luxury that's comfortable,"This is by far my favorite hotel. I have stay in many and this is the most comfortable. There are rooms over the fountain which is fun to watch. There are 2 floors of spa-like rooms if you want that atmosphere, with aome over the fountains as well. There is a separate spa tower that avoids the casino, with the spa, gym, coffee store & separate pool entrance if you want a more quiet experience. There are a few pools to choose from that are not a scene. Love to start and finish my trip at the lobby bar with piano music and great snacks! Love it here!"
91,5.0,Best stay on the Strip,We have stayed at many hotels on the strip and the Bellagio is hands down the best. All employees were very accommodating and very friendly. Best service from the minute we got there till we left. Will stay there again!!!
92,4.0,Beautiful Hotel. Overall Amazing Stay.,"Overall we had an amazing stay at the resort from the 5th to the 11th. We had a Resort Tower King room on the 6th floor with an amazing view. The soaking tub with window was what sold the room to us and had us move our reservations here. Room was spotless upon arrival. Almost all staff were friendly and super helpful. The hotel is gorgeous. Self parking was a breeze with easy access to the hotel. Casino had a large variety of games with minimums on slots mainly in the 50 cent to dollar range. Table minimums depended on the time and day, but generally were able to find $25 during slow and $50 during busier times. A few things prevented the rating from being 5 stars. One day the room was not cleaned despite no privacy sign on door and us being gone the majority of the day."
93,5.0,Beautiful Lunar New Year display at Bellagio Gardens,Even if you are not staying at Bellagio : do stop in at the beautiful Conservatory .

94,4.0,Strip View Deluxe King,"What isn't to love about the Bellagio! It is absolutely beautiful, especially the conservatory. Enjoyed our time here, would love to a coffee maker in the room! Also, recommend skipping the breakfast buffet if possible."
95,3.0,"I expect to lose, but I don't expect to never win...","Slots seemed more stingy then I remember them being 18 years ago. Lost both times, but winning a little here and there makes for a much better experience. I spent a lot over 3 days and not even one win over $35. I expect to lose, but I don't expect to never win. My advice is learn the table games and stay away from the slots."
96,1.0,Lackluster hotel,"Felt for the amount of money that the hotel/casino would have been a lot more high class, compared to ceasers palace, this place was like a motel 6! Just didn’t feel like the hotel was worth the money."
97,5.0,Bellagio best in town,"Our stay at the Bellagio was excellent! The room was clean, well appointed and a view of the fountains! The restaurants were exceptional and the staff professional. The front desk person were helpful and provided us with great tips for our stay. Unfortunately we lost at the slots but the experience was fantastic! We’re planning our next trip already! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
98,3.0,Hard time to give a credit for just a $100.00,"I was told that I have $350 food credit. The guy who checked me in, wrote a 350 credit. Went to the buffet and spent almost $500. The following day, I went to the main lobby just to make sure that I have the $350. I was told I only have $250. She said she will inform the Manager. Went back again in the evening and they said they can’t do anything. I tried again when we check out. It took us almost an hour to take care of the extra $100. It should have been resolved from the beginning. We have to run and catch our flight which we almost did not make it."
99,5.0,Wonderful experience,"We spent three nights at Bellagio in Feb 2022. The location is fantastic, almost at the middle of the strip while both north and south of the strip are within walking distance. The indoor space is gorgeous, with a good number of restaurants. The staff are friendly and the casino is great."
100,5.0,Beautiful place,"Bellagio is so beautiful, elegant. I loved everything single thing about it. Will definitely come back. We had a fountain view and it was spectacular, honestly I thought I would get tired of it, but it never happened, i could watch it all day long"
101,3.0,Nothing exceptional,"The Bellagio’s atmosphere is amazing. The room was great. They almost seemed short staffed. I was there for a week, and gambled daily at the Bellagio, and I was never offered a drink. The staff was very friendly."
102,4.0,Everything as promised - apart from the noise,"An incredible stay at the Bellagio that brought back memories of watching ocean’s eleven. It’s a really fancy hotel that manages to cater to your needs even when it is busy. We had drinks at Petrossian with the excellent pianist, enjoyed sushi and more at Yellowtail and had a spectacular meal at Lago with stunning fountain views. The lobby and lunar new year display were spectacular and housed our breakfast spot at Sadelle’s, a must visit destination. The casino floor itself is pretty big with table limits varying a lot depending on the time of day. We saw one blackjack as high as $300 minimum on the main floor and as low as £15 on one occasion in the week. The pool area is very relaxing with great drinks service, good music and general chilled vibes. Our only issue was the"
103,4.0,Great Location to All Amenities,Bellagio stands up to its Reputation. Rooms and Staff were Excellent and the Check-In and Check Out Process was Both Quick and Efficient. The Location is also Excellent allowing easy access to locations both on and off the strip. Excellent place to stay especially if you are planning a trip to Vegas for the first time!
104,1.0,DIRTY ROOM AND COLD BREAKFAST,"Not our best Hotel experience by a country mile...On arrival room had food outside our door and food on our carpet... On return from breakfast one day ...We found that the room had been cleaned , but the door had been left open and totally insecure. I immediately called guest services and complained to Ingrid who took our call. After explaining what had happened to my amazement Ingrid suggested WE had left the room door unlocked and ajar…I then explained that we were not magicians but tourists who had left the door secured and locked and the room was in need of cleaning and housekeeping and then when we returned that the door was open and ajar and the room had been made up and fully cleaned and then the persons responsible for the cleaning had not secured the door…Ingrid"
105,4.0,Nice Hotel but Smokey Casino,"Hotel for the most part was excellent except for the smoke in the casino. Lots of it and all the time. Lago Restaurant was good but expensive for what you got. Nice view! Woopie! Room was cleaned three times out of six days, not what I would expect of Bellagio and for what we paid. Sadell's restaurant for breakfast was excellent, but remember to make a reservation as the line is quite long if you don't. All staff everywhere from the front desk to the service peope in the restaurants were excellent. Mina's restaurant at the Bellagio was awful! Overcooked food, sauces that covered a great steak that were not good, and a not so nice sommelier who gave up! Food was very pricey besides, but the GM was very nice and accommodating as was the server. Room service was good"
106,5.0,Bellagio is incredible,"The bellagio is the only place i will stay when i come to vegas. Like if i can’t get a room there, i just don’t come. I’ve never had the slightest issue with anything. Everyone is so friendly all the time"
107,5.0,Bellagio is awesome!,"We stayed in the fountain view suite and it was worth every extra penny. Watching the fountain shows nightly was a highlight every night. The room was great, staff were friendly & helpful, restaurants were amazing, and casino was clean and spacious."
108,5.0,Fountain View,Relaxing visit with beautiful view of fountains and the strip. Room was like a sanctuary. Huge shower but water pressure not so great. Room a little warm with automatic curtains open. Not a lot of casual dining options on property so bring dress clothes.. Great atmosphere. Pool was nice.
109,5.0,Bellagio is still the king,I’ll make it quick. If you want to stay in a luxurious and impressive casino go to the Bellagio. None of the riff raff only class. We had an outstanding time for my wifes bday. We even won some money. It was truly a wonderful experience.
110,2.0,Yacht Club Members Only!,"This hotel was probably really nice awhile ago. And the people that stayed there during that time are still staying here. Definitely an older crowd that one could mistake for a yacht club members only retreat. The Strip View King Room was very small and poorly lit even with the small window. The mirror in the bathroom was covered in orange-ish glue around the vanity lighting, there were rips in the carpet, and the bare minimum for amenities in the room. Not up to date AT ALL technology wise. No USB outlets and the alarm clock/radio had a holder for what appeared to be a first generation iPod. Again, probably a really nice room about 15-20 years ago…"
111,5.0,Great property.,"My husband and I stayed here for the first time and it was wonderful. We actually never left the Bellagio it had everything there. Also, great atmosphere. Loved the garden. Great service. I would totally recommend anyone to stay here."
112,5.0,Excellent Resort Hotel,Very friendly staff. Very clean. The The only complaint is we would like free water. Even at the little coffee shop they would not give us free water. We had to purchase a $5 bottled water. Everything was beautiful!
113,4.0,Overall,I felt the food could’ve been better at the 24 hour restaurant. The drinks was not made with top shelf liquors. The people taking orders and serving drinks sometimes would speed pass you while trying to order drinks.
114,5.0,Annual Vegas trip,"As usual everything was excellent at the Bellagio. I know prices have gone up everywhere, just seems a bit more here. Table minimums have increased a lot. Slot payouts seemed to be less and I heard that from others as well."
115,2.0,One of most popular and famous on strip you can skip,"Besides the fountain and fabulous flower Chinese garden you get the most underwhelming $60 brunch buffet with not onr not 2 but 3 different potatoes dishes, two sweet potatoe and one butternut squash, turkey stuffing, pizza....the cheapest food! Shower that doesn't drain in room so you stand in dirty water. Gliz and glamor bells and whistles but WAY underwhelming up close."
116,5.0,Fantastic service!,Fantastic service from the front desk to the blackjack dealers! Will definitely be back!! We were also very pleased with the ease dining in such nice places never having left the hotel. Keep up the excellent work. Thanks
117,1.0,Overrated,"Will not be staying at Bellagio in the near future, staff at front lobby and desk are highly rude. Buffet was not worth 49.00 the food was terrible and outdated I would much rather eat at Cosmo or Aria"
118,5.0,Birthday celebration,"Trip with my grandson to celebrate my birthday, lots of fun things to do and lots to see, perfect weather, professional, courteous staff made this trip special for me and my grandson, will definitely be back"
119,3.0,Just ok,"We stayed at the Bellagio for a 40th birthday weekend. Our ""redone"" king suite was fine but not anything special. The fixtures and furnishings seemed cheap. We usually stay at Cesaers and our room at the Bellagio was mediocre in comparison. We were told by the casino host comps were being applied, only to find out at check out nothing was put through. We spent thousands in two days and and this lack of follow through left a bad taste in my mouth. Disappointing."
120,3.0,Outdated and rude staff,If you go here DO NOT USE the mobile check in you will be able to get in the room once then you’ll have to wait in line for a true key so might as well do it at the start. Room had three dirty socks candy wrappers and bottle caps on the floor as soon as we walked in. Glad to see they did include their Covid cleaning protocols for us to read over and notice all that wasn’t completed.
121,5.0,Awesome,"I was very happy with the service by the staff and the facility was excellence. I would recommend Bellagio 100%! The room was very clean, better than what I've expected. Friendly service by the staff is the top reason why I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and facility is not that far behind the great service by hotel & casino staff."

123,1.0,Blood on the Bathroom Wall and a Hole punch on the bedroom Wall. We were moved to another room without any assistance,There was Blood on the Bathroom Wall and a hole punched on the bedroom wall. The room should not have been rented. When changed to another room. The hotel staff didn't offer to take our luggage to the new room. We asked for an upgraded room since we were celebrating an anniversary/birthday and they told us there were no upgrades available but once we complained about the Blood and Hole in the wall. We were changed to another room.
124,5.0,Best NFL Playoff Weekend Ever!,Loved the hotel Great customer service Can’t wait to go back Felt like home! My friends and I come in the NFL playoff weekend We enjoyed the sports book Saturday and Sunday We got reserved seats for the games What a weekend to see the best NFL playoff games in the last 50 years! They could not have been more attentive and friendly service ! Bellagio’s has it all great food the service is second to none in Vegas My friends and I traveled in from Texas and North Carolina to enjoy a relaxing fun and exciting weekend
125,3.0,Less than clean,"The standard of cleanliness was not what we expected. We were assuming that this was due to limited staffing in Housekeeping due to COVID issues. We really enjoyed ""O"". The food was exquisite. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of everything, near to City Center and Linq."
126,5.0,Amazing Experience,"I planned a quick get away trip for my husband’s birthday. Everything about this hotel was amazing! He loved everything! We had an early flight, and we were able to check in as soon as we arrived! They were very accommodating!"
127,3.0,Good service and decent stay,"The glass window was dirty making the fountain view room less enjoyable. We regret paying for the room with the view. Also, we could never got connected to the spa to reserve the massage. We had to go there in person. By that time, there were limited availability."
128,5.0,Birthday getaway,I had already pre-checked in but stopped by the front desk to inquire about a nicer room. Rafael helped us in deciding to upgrade to a fountain view room which absolutely made my stay !!!! He also presented me with a rose for my birthday!! The room was clean and beds extremely comfortable. The pool area is lovely. I also appreciated being able to charge back to my room at Resort amenities. I also very much appreciated the high security at the guest elevators. Requiring a room key to enter the area. I would not hesitate in staying there again.
129,1.0,The Black Jack dealers are trash. Do a somewhat decent job or quit,"Gambin staff is rude and disrespectful. You are better of throwing dice on a corner somewhere than putting up with their terrible attitude, especially if you just want to have a good time and don’t care about winning. Place is just “ok” but very over hyped"
130,2.0,Resort fees are robbery,Bellagio makes people agree to a money grabbing nightly fee of $45 or you can't get a room. That's robbery. They make a big display of respect for veterans but won't waive that ridiculous fee. There's no excuse for lies and robbery. Their prices are high enough.
131,5.0,Awesome!!,"Outstanding service and staff. The restaurants at the Bellagio are amazing! We arrived early, before check in, but the staff went out of their way to get our room ready. We have stayed at several hotels on the strip and Bellagio was by far the BEST."
132,2.0,Birthday trip,"While checking into my room and the first person you see is at the front desk, was rude!!! I was so happy to be at the Bellagio and told her it was my birthday and she didn't blink or acknowledge me, didn't say happy birthday or enjoy your stay with us, NOTHING!!! Then the first room we were in was dirty and had problems, like the TV. We got moved into another room that also had problems but Gerald from engineering came up and fixed them right away and gave me a coupon for 50 towards dining. Then when I ordered room service, Julio delivered our food in less time then we were told and was an absolute gentleman. I called to give him a compliment and his boss, I believe it was James, the in room dining director was amazing and I told him the problems which had occurred and he"
133,4.0,Beautiful hotel with nice amenities and staff,"Parking was conveniently located. Our check-in process was quick. I was not given the room for which I reserved. I was not given an upgrade. Instead I was given an alternate room, without a fountain view. The restaurant options are varied and very good."
134,5.0,Amazing!,"Beautiful Hotel, Beautiful ambiance, Friendly Staff! Cannot wait to stay again. Only issue, the air conditioning/fan did. It blow cold air. The amenities and location are perfectly situated near all the action"
135,5.0,Luxurious stay,The amenities were very nice. The room size was generous and it was appointed in a lovely motif. The decor was neat and elegant. Checking in online was quick and convenient. We had a great view of the pool area.
136,5.0,Shot Show week,"Even though the Covid ""pandemic"" was still present, we felt very comfortable and safe with how the situation was handled. Cleaning staff was very prompt in addressing a couple of minor issues. Great overall experience, and we had a room with a superb view of the fountain!"
137,4.0,Go away Covid-19,We have always stayed at the Bellagio because of its cleanness of their rooms and the players floors. This year was a big let down. The room we got needed updating and a good cleaning. It was always one of the upscale Casinos but they have become a Panama City because from lowering their room rates. We love their piano bar and always bring our friends here. We hope when Covid-19 is gone and over so the all of Las Vegas comes back to glory again.
138,3.0,Las Vegas furniture market,Hotel clean and nice. Hotel staff should have enforced stricter Mask rules. No buses to world market center big Disappointment (Bellagio use to have this During market trade show) I spent a ton on Taxis
139,5.0,Fabulous,"The Bellagio is quality at every turn! Fantastic food, rooms, staff and easy online check in. Prime and Le Cirque are beyond amazing! Rooms are beautifully appointed and soothingly relaxing. …AND THE FOUNTAIN IS SPECTACULAR!"
140,1.0,Bellagio Concierge failed us,"We had a 2 day layover in Vegas after our Yuma trip. we chose the Bellagio because their pool is open in the winter. The first night we arrived too late to use the pool. The next day (today). We intended to use the pool and hot tubs for maybe 1.5 hours. We called Maureen at the concierge desk. From what I understand, she is the boss. I asked her how late the pool and hot tubs were open. She informed us they were open until 5pm. She also told us that there was a snack bar by the pool where we could order a sandwich. When we arrived at the pool, the snack bar was closed. So, we ended up wasting time getting a sandwich inside the casino. We still thought we were going to have a little over an hour for using the pool/hot tubs. When we showed our key to the pool attendant,"
141,2.0,This property has lost its luster and the staff are unable to assist.,"The property is in one of the best locations but with all of the other hotel options to choose from, I would recommend staying at another property. The staff no longer has the ability they once had to address problems and correct them immediately"
142,3.0,Bellagio is not anymore the amazing hotel it used to be,"Room were dirty (underwear form previous guest hanging in the closet), way to address the issue was awful, staff doing the bare minimum to address any issues or services except for the ball man. Room service is like ordering form door dash…you get a $150 meal in a brown bag… 5 stars"
143,3.0,Bellagio did not meet my expectations,"The property itself is beautiful with the stunning lobby, seasonal conservatory, and iconic fountain show. I had a pleasant check-in experience and was even upgraded to a room with a strip view. Very nice! The location is also perfect! However, it seems that the housekeeping issues are still ongoing. I found coffee stains on the wall behind the nightstand lamp and mold growing on the shower ceiling. I'd expect that from the lower tier MGM properties but not Bellagio. It was disappointing because this is the best property MGM has to offer in Las Vegas and I've had cleaner rooms at other properties."
144,4.0,Nice but lacked some things,"Positives first, there are always cabs available. The buffet is amazing. It is VERY VERY hard to get a drink while gambling...we rarely got one during our entire stay and when we did we would wait 30-40 minutes. The room for the price I felt was lackluster compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed at. It was nearly impossible to find coffee at least I was unaware of how to other than trek a mile to the lowest level of the casino for Starbucks. Careful with the refrigerator...VERY VERY VERY expensive. I know...it is Vegas."
145,5.0,Love the Bellagio,"Rooms are pristine, bed was a dream. Really nice. I like the option of checking in remotely and the option of using the cellphone as a key. Walking distance to mall and restaurants / shopping right across the street."
146,3.0,Dirty Room!,Extra fees when arriving to check in. That’s something I feel should be let known before arriving. Our room was not clean. The carpet looked liked it hadn’t been vacuumed and the bathroom floor was grooms as well. Also there was hair left on the sink from whomever was there before us. Will not stay at the Bellagio again!
147,5.0,Best hotel ever,"My hotel experience was incredible. The staff is super friendly and professional. My room was very clean and elegant. I felt like I was in the middle of the strip, so walking to where I wanted to go wasn’t that big of a deal"
148,5.0,Birthday fun,Just a quick trip to celebrate a friends birthday. Well the rooms have been Completely renovated very nice. The restaurant was great. The casino was so much fun. As with any trip it was not perfect but the staff and management made everything great. So to me it’s not how perfect it is its the wonderful way thing we’re resolved. Loved my stay!!!
149,4.0,Beautiful hotel....,"It is a beautiful hotel, but the rooms are showing some wear. It might be time for a face lift. Also, the cold water never got cold, it was always luke warm. The only thing that I was disappointed about was there was not a coffee maker in the room. If I wanted a cup while getting ready I had to go the Lobby."
150,1.0,Worst hotel ever!,From the moment I walked through the door to the moment of check out it was the worst experience of my life! Do not waste one penny there! The staff was rude and not helpful. The food was awful. Rooms were dated abd overpriced. They even went so far as to trick me into spending more money on a “nicer” room that was worse than the original one I had and didn’t have the decency to even credit me back the money.
151,1.0,Very disappointed,After paying about $400 per room for the holiday of a lifetime in the Bellagio we’re all left very disappointed. We were given a room in the spa tower overlooking the freeway - room clearly hadn’t been modernised since the hotel was built. Bathroom had one sink where the taps didn’t work and a large amount of rust came out the the bath taps which wasn’t cleaned out the entire 6 days of our stay. After such a horrendous room rate (plus the obligatory resort fee of course) there was no complimentary tea/coffee or even water and the prices for both room service and all other food and drink in the hotel was ridiculous. There are far better hotels on the strip for much less money and I would encourage others to use these and not the Bellagio. What a total let down for our special
152,5.0,Cirque Tickets,We bought tickets for Cirque ‘O’ at the Bellagio and for some reason we were allocated 4 instead of 2. The ticket company were closed for the weekend and we had no other option but to go to the Bellagio itself. We spoke to Judy Ho at Concierge and she was amazing. She put us at ease and sorted our issue immediately. She was so friendly and I would thoroughly recommend contacting her should you need help with anything.
153,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,Came here for CYN and had a wonderful stay. Can't wait to come back again! Rooms were spacious and clean. Plenty of excellent restaurants and shopping nearby. The fountain show and interior were top notch. A must stay when visiting Vegas!
154,2.0,Do yourself a favor- stay somewhere else,"Looked forward to a long weekend away, and this hotel disappointed from the moment we checked in. We usually stay at the Wynn and thought we would try somewhere new. We had to switch rooms twice, the first room didn't have fountain view which we paid for, and the second room had dried urine on the floor, spit on the mirrors, and a used empty water bottle left behind. On our third day I noticed that housekeeping gave us a dirty washcloth after ""cleaning"" our room. We weren't told until our third day that we had a welcome package provided by Amex that included 2-$30 daily breakfast vouchers and 2 complementary welcome drinks. We attempted to order our drinks and were told from the bartender that ""we didn't have the right documentation and we needed to go back to guest"
155,4.0,Still a lovely property !,"We took advantage of a comp offer and stayed two nights. Upon arrival we we’re upgraded to a beautiful fountain view room with a panoramic view of the strip. It’s been 20 years since my last stay in Bellagio, the room decor is more simple and subdued. The property still does a great job maintaining its beauty. World class upscale boutique shopping. Very crowded casino floor. My preference is still the Encore and the Four Season ,where I’m heading as I write this ."
156,3.0,Cracked zink was start of issues with our room,"Noise from freeway, that sounded like a monorail was passing by all day and night. Shower partially plugged so it kept backing up so short showers were a must. Not enough champoo was provided unless we called for more."
157,3.0,Awful bartender,"Hotel was nice room is very comfortable. Casino is very busy but well staffed for no wait at table games. Unfortunately the older bartender on the right side of the baccarat bar on 3 FEB 2022 around 10pm completely ruined our experience at this property, Very rude and argumentative with a simple order."
158,3.0,There is not added value that justifies cost,The last night that we were there the room was not serviced and someone walked into our room in the middle of the night. She claimed to be the cleaning staff and they thought we were checking out. It ended up waking us all up and I could not fall back to sleep because I was petrified. Although the hotel is very clean and the restaurants are delicious albeit expensive. The pools were closed Everyday by 4 p.m. as was the Jim there is no added value for staying here versus a hotel like the Palazzo or the Venetian that are less expensive and probably offer more value in their rooms and sizes and amenities
159,1.0,Extremely overpriced for the quality.,Extremely overpriced for the quality they provide. My purse was robbed and the spa staff was very rude. The hotel rooms were clean but only had one robe and two towels. Had to call down for more towels and an additional Robe since there were two people staying in the room.
160,5.0,Best place to stay in Vegas!,"Booked the Bellagio without ever been in Las Vegas before. Boy did we get lucky! After walking the strip and seeing everything else around, the Bellagio is hands down the best place! Very clean, friendly and perfectly located in the middle of all the action. Definitely going back!"
161,1.0,Bellagio lost it quality,"when you go for fun what is most important, and nun of our group member ware happy after spending so much money at the table. bar restoration table service room amity was nothing then why stay in Bellagio"
162,4.0,Very nice view,"We paid an extra fee to get the view of the fountains and the window was really covered with face prints and smudges, I think they could have at least cleaned the window since you have to pay extra for that view."
163,4.0,Fun Vegas trip,"We enjoyed the room, being spoiled by housekeeping, and just the overall hotel. The only issue is that not everything in the weekdays are open full time. Spago was impressive, outstanding meal with fun during the water show. Sadelle's Cafe great breakfast spot but not open at night. Noodles was good, but not a very hot meal. Snacks, OMG, stay away! Bellagio Patisserie was exciting for snacks or quick bite, only issue is long lines its that good."
164,5.0,Beautiful Bellagio,"Love this hotel, view is spectacular from rooms facing fountain. And rooms are spacious with awesome bathroom and shower. Super clean and well appointed. Best location in the heart of the strip. Have stayed here now 3 times, and never disappoints."
165,1.0,Terrible experience at the poker room,"I would give 0 star if I could. If you got nothing to do on a Sunday and enjoys to get yelled at in the face while you wait one hour for your food, this is the perfect place to be. I came to the poker room to play the 5/10 game. I order food at the table like everybody else. I waited 2 dealer change that's 60 minutes past and no one came over. I called the restaurant and ordered so when the runner came they don't need to order and wait. The runner past table several times and never stopped. So I asked dealer to stop the runner. He stopped and I said "" I just need the food to be picked up"" he said: I'm not responsible to pick up your food. Did I order your food? No. You are not my boss. Are you my boss? I'm not responsible to pick up your food if I didn't order it."" He said that"
166,1.0,Used to be nice..not anymore post-Covid,"So much smoke you can't see the other side of the casino. The room smells of smoke so badly, our clothes, my wife's hair, our luggage all smell like smoke. The Nightclub is so loud, we needed noise-canceling headphones on 24 floors up just to sleep, so don't pay for an upgraded room with fountain view. Feels like Fremont street and not the Bellagio experience pre-Covid."
167,5.0,Exceptional stay!,"This is a world class facility that leaves no expenses when accommodating guests! Location is ideal, casino floor is perfect, amenities are well kept and we stay here every trip to Las Vegas. I wouldn't change anything"
168,5.0,Great Overall Trip,The Hotel was clean and very nice. The location is great because you can walk to other casinos and restaurants. The food was good. They have a Starbucks at the hotel so my wife was super happy. If your facing the strip it does get very loud from the club across the street. We could help them until 2am but hey is Vegas.
169,4.0,Bellagio,I loved staying here. The bed so comfy to sleep on the view was amazing. One I still don't understand why so much resort fees and the charge to park there if staying there but other then that amazing.
170,5.0,Beautiful casino hotel,My wife and I celebrated our 43 wedding anniversary at Bellagio. The staff was friendly and attentive. Our room overlooked the fountain which was a real treat. Room service was fast and efficient. We have stayed at a number of casino hotels - this is one of the nicest.
171,5.0,Great couples' weekend stay,"We stayed 3 nights at the Bellagio. It was the first for my wife, and I had not visited in many years. We booked with American Express Travel and had amazing benefits (breakfast & dining credit). The location and views (fountain view room) was outstanding. The food was very good quality as well."
172,3.0,Wish it would of been better,"Found hair in the shower and bed, transferred to another room where the fridge/mini bar kept on being locked even after a request to have it unlocked. Digital key did not work on elevator and couldn’t print one because QR code kept saying expired."
173,1.0,Tricked at front desk on a room upgrade because they work on commission. Has this happened to anyone else?,was tripped at the front desk to a room upgrade so I booked a $300 room through American Express got charged another 300 or so from Bellagio Drexel ended up with a $700 room all because they had no two queens available supposedly found out they work on commission so I believe it was intentional
174,5.0,Amazing Vacation!!,Amazing time celebrating my birthday at Bellagio!! Prime Steakhouse was the best dinner of my life and everyone in the casino was super friendly. My casino host Ryan Guadiz was amazing and took great care of me. Could not have had a better time.
175,4.0,Overall a great place to stay,Room was clean and I would recommend coming here if you want a clean comfortable place to stay and gamble. There’s plenty of things to see as well eat and shops dry close by. Besides mobile check in issues I would give 9 out of 10.
176,5.0,I love Vegas,"Beliagio is the best place in Vegas!!! This weekend I booked Beliagio for one night and tried to do everything online. Including check in and digital key. I don’t like all those gadgets but with the Covid 19 u need to change your habits unfortunately… And it appeared extremely easy to check in through mgm app, I put there my ETA and received room number in minutes, I opened my room with my IPhone!! Amazing!! So easy, convenient and simple to do experience!!! 10 out 10."
177,2.0,Honeymoon trip,The check in wasn’t as smooth as it could’ve been. I arranged with their guest services beforehand because I was staying for my honeymoon. The woman who checked me in did not care about my previous arrangements. Rooms were subpar. I stepped on a broken fingernail from previous guest that was left on the bathroom floor. Room was obviously not cleaned prior to my checking in.
178,5.0,Always the best,"Even with the covid setbacks, Bellagio still remains tops in guest service. Jeffery G, Angela H, Paul at the front desk, Carmen in guest services….always treat me like family. Can’t wait to return. Oh and Eddy, Brandy, Mitch, Mallory and Sydney at the pool! Great group."
179,5.0,Best casino experience in town!,"The Bellagio offers the best casino experience in Las Vegas. It is upscale and beautiful. It offers all varieties of poker machines, slot machines, and table games. There is something for everyone! It also offers many fine dining restaurants. The employees are the best. They treat you like a valued guest."
180,2.0,Poor service,To much money for the service to be the way it was. Front desk agents were rude when the phone bill as answered I even got hung up on. When trying to talk about the billing process they were rude and didn’t help me understand why I was constantly being falsely charged for things
181,5.0,Concierge Furlena,"She went over and above in her service for us. Gave us several restaurant ideas and even showed us photos of some of their dishes and menus. Among other questions we asked her. We appreciate it, thank you!"
182,5.0,Great location,It's the Bellagio....always was and still is one of the best places to stay in Vegas. Well appointed and ample sized room. Centrally located....easy to get uptown or downtown with the bus stop right in front of the hotel. The hotel was quite busy when we went and I would say most guests observed mask rules
183,5.0,Excellent service.,"The staff, particularly Corrina Rambicur, we’re outstanding. The rooms are excellent. All the staff was friendly, cooperative and seemed to enjoy working at Bellagio. Their enthusiasm was genuine. Several went out of their way to provide information and directions."
184,4.0,Beautiful hotel. Be careful of unexpected charges due to third party booking!,I booked our trip through Allegiant airlines. They offered a non-stop flight from our area to Vegas. I paid for the Bellagio hotel as part of the package. When I arrived at the Bellagio they asked for a credit card for any additional charges such as a $58 per day fee. I asked what was this for because I had already paid for the hotel. They said it was due to using a third party for booking the hotel. Total charges were $285 that were on top of the payment I had already paid to stay at the hotel. It seems that if you book your stay at anywhere other than the Bellagio you're going to see this charge.
185,5.0,Clean,"The hotel was big and clean, we loved how everything was nearby. All staff are friendly. The guests were all happy people. To my surprise, the elevators were incredibly fast. I didn’t have to wait long to get to our room."
186,3.0,"nice on the outside, meh on the inside.","The Bellagio has a great lobby and looks great from the outside. However, you'll pay a lot for rooms that are not so spectacular. The bed was nice but everything else was way out of date (ipod player in room, landline phone in the bathroom, TV and remote from 2007). You can stay at a much better resort on the strip for the same amount of money."
187,2.0,Not 5 star,"Standard has gone down, not what it used to be. Not a 5 star experience any more. Spa service was really underwhelming. Daily pre authorizations on my CC every time I charged anything to the room. Literally 4K in pre authorizations for a 4 night stay. Geez! Just not what it used to be. Overpriced food that was mediocre at best. Property becoming a bit dated as well. Saw a few homeless people in the hotel. Half naked girls walking around asking if we wanted to take pics. MGM rewards program personnel acted pretty petty to someone gambling thousands of dollars during their stay."
188,3.0,Complementary rooms,We have a complementary stay so I guess that’s why the service and the rooms was not exceptional.. i guessed … the valley parking service was great the whole 3 days of stay since we keep on going out to visit other places.
189,5.0,Unmatched Service,"We've been consistently pleased with our stays at Bellagio. The environment, restaurant selection, service staff are very attentive. It's central location to Paris, Cosmopolitan, Aria and Caesars properties provide ample choices for entertainment."
190,5.0,Delicious!! Sublime!,We stayed in a fountain view suite and it was all it was supposed to be… the view was amazing… the room was impeccable… and the service was sublime. We did have a little issue in one of the restaurants but then again it was very busy at that time… would definitely stay there again
191,5.0,Amazing Weekend,"The room was amazing, and so was the view from the room. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was to die for. The staff was very kind and helpful, from the bell hops to the staff roaming about the hotel/casino. Will definitely be looking forward to my next visit at the Bellagio!"
192,4.0,Disappointed trip,First time stay at the Spa Tower and very disappointed. Room was facing to the roof top in the corner. Noisy when next door is using the shower. Refreshment charges to my room when I checked in. The explanation was I moved the items which I did not. Very unfriendly response from the front desk
193,3.0,Disappointed in our room,"The room was lacking for the following reasons: 1. There was a large wet spot on the carpet upon our arrival and we only stayed one night. It made it uncomfortable to walk around without shoes. 2. The TV repeatedly shut off and refused to turn back on. We had to unplug it and replug it back in twice to get it working. Again, we only stayed one night so it was annoying. 3. The shower pressure was low. 4. The shower had trash in it upon our arrival. 5. The window displaying the fountain was very dirty. We booked the room for our anniversary to have a nice view of the fountains but the dirty window took away from the experience."
194,5.0,Beautiful Resort,"From check in to check out, the staff was welcoming with a smile and the rooms were clean, beautiful and spacious. The restaurant options were great along with the food they offered. We will return again soon!"
195,5.0,Perfection,The moment you walk in you are treated as a special guest by all staff. The decor in all areas is so beautiful. The room is exceptionally beautiful and quiet. The dining options are great as well as the gaming areas.
196,4.0,Worth the visit anytime.,"The Bellagio needs some room furniture maintenance and updating, but the hotel as a whole is very welcoming, enjoyable, and beautiful! I would recommend this experience at least once in everyone’s life."
197,5.0,1st time staying,"After many many trips to Las Vegas we finally got to stay at the Bellagio. OMG we will never be able to stay anywhere else. The hotel is absolutely stunning, the rooms are amazing and the customer service is on another level. From the moment we got to the front desk to check-in it was obvious the Bellagio was a step above the rest of the strip. The desk clerk was extremely friendly, helpful, professional and courteous. The experience just elevated from there. The entire staff we encountered during our stay made the whole experience truly amazing. My sincerest thanks to all the great folks who work hard to make guests like myself feel very welcome. While agree that some of the food prices were on the high side, especially the mini bar, the trip and stay was still worth"
198,5.0,friends retreat,"it was fantastic from the time we checked in to the time we left, everyone was friendly and helpful, the room was very spacious and clean, the resturants were great and the guest services were very accomadating when we were looking for tickets to a show."
199,5.0,Beautiful hotel.,"The room was awesome. We loved staying at the Bellagio. Everything about the hotel was beautiful. Our only hesitation was the cost of food, and the prices of items in the minifridge and the cost of snacks on the credenza were ridiculous. However, we loved the hotel, and the conservatory was beautiful."
200,5.0,Pure Luxury,"We stayed in the 2-Bedroom Suite and could not have asked for a better experience. The unexpected details we found in every inch of the resort were absolutely exquisite. Our room was breath-taking - view, furniture, wet bar stocking, & space. The beds were a bit firm, but we absolutely loved the room, the resort, and the staff"
201,5.0,Excellence,"I have stayed at the Bellagio multiple times over the last year or so.. Each time I visit ,it reminds me why I will stay at the Bellagio or stay home..!! Friendly, courteous staff as well as an ambiance like nowhere else in Las Vegas. I will see y'all again in April!!"
202,5.0,Fun Ladies trip,"Loved the contact less check in. The lobby was beautifully decorated. Our room was clean and the bellman was very informative. The pool was also open and heated. The drinks were expensive, but we are in Vegas."
203,4.0,Great to be back at the Bellagio!,"It felt like home coming back to the Bellagio. Staff is friendly and atmosphere is convivial. The resort is clean and beautiful. The Bellagio would be perfect except for the shower area in the renovated rooms. Also, the room service could do with more options and better presentation during delivery."
204,5.0,Dream come true!!!!!,"We had a great time !! since the moment we got there staff members were friendly, didn’t have to wait that long for the check in, beautiful place, the rooms were very very clean and food was excellent , About the casino I saw a lot of people winning also I like that way that they have set up the machines, definitely I will recommend this beautiful hotel to any one !!!"
205,5.0,Great,"Beautiful hotel. Customer service was perfect. We had a room with a fountain view and it was awesome. I found myself eager to get back to the room, just to watch the fountains. We booked 6 months in advance and had a great rate."
206,5.0,great trip,"We always have a wonderful time at the Bellagio. Great people, excellent food, fun gaming, and a relaxing spa. The atrium is always a beautiful marvel to enjoy. Who could ask for more? We are already planning our next trip."
207,5.0,First Time,It was our first time to actually stay overnight at Bellagio and will not be our last! The view of the fountains from our room was spectacular and breathtaking. The service and cleanliness was outstanding. Look forward to our next stay in April!
208,5.0,Birthday getaway,"I went out for my birthday, and Rafael presented me with a rose. He helped us upgrade to a fountain view room, which made my stay. Check in was swift and courteous. Great view, HUGE SHOWER !! Pool is fabulous"
209,1.0,The name does not reflect the staff service,"Front desk staff was very unprofessional, our reservation was made for king bedroom, when i did not accept the upgrade due to the high price, he said that he has only one room for us, but it is with a handicap future, when i asked for a manager to talk to, he said ok i have a room for you. bad service, rate too expensive. bathroom has dirty toilet paper in the floor."
210,5.0,"A peaceful, refined oasis in the heart of the Strip","Bellagio is an elegant hotel with many luxury features. The lobby and conservatory are beautiful and our room was newly renovated with sleek, understated decor in sliver and gold. The swimming pools and hot tubs are located in a very nice courtyard with wonderful landscaping and plenty of room to spread out. It's truly one of the most beautiful swimming pool complexes in Vegas. Overall, I think the Venetian might be a little more fun and the rooms there are all suites...but Bellagio has a more logical layout making it easier to navigate plus it has much nicer pools. So, there are two good Italian choices in the heart of the Strip."
211,5.0,Beautiful Room and Hotel.,"The entire trip was excellent. Hotel is beautiful. Staff is very attentive and friendly. The fountains are amazing, especially being able to watch them from you room. Convenient checking in and out process. Easy to walk to nearby Hotel/Casinos."
212,4.0,Dlteller's stay,Room had no TV remote and no information on show or no guide in room. Had to call twice for TV remote didn't get until the 2nd day. The the gal that drop the TV remove of informed my to get a voucher. From the front lobby. Lobby didn't help.
213,4.0,Bellagio,"Our check in and check out went smoothly. All staff was super helpful. The water in our shower backed up when in use, which isn't great having to stand in inch deep water during a shower. We also had some fantastic blackjack dealers."
214,4.0,Our Last Minute Winter 3-day Getaway,"Woke up on a cold Chicago Sunday Morning and making plans to leave in 3 days for Vegas. What a great idea. Stayed at Bellagio (was on my bucket list) and the hotel and room did not disappoint. Stayed Wednesday thru Saturday, so glad we did. Had a Wellness King, facing the mountains, what a joy!"
215,1.0,"Beautiful lobby, horrible room",The lobby is gorgeous - we were there during Chinese New Year and the decorations were breathtaking. But the room was a big disappointment. Outdated colors and furnishings and smell of stale cigarettes. This was one of the Cypress Suites facing the fountain. Even with drapes open the space felt dark and not quite clean - but that is probably because of the furniture and furnishings. This place needs a renovation!
216,1.0,Spa has terrible customer service,Spa horrible denied entrance by staff when we were told we can access is with a $50.00 dlls fee they didn’t let us and were extreme rude about it the hotel is blah honestly it’s just alll about the location cosmopolitan is way better value for money .
217,5.0,MGM Rewards and check-in experince,"MGM rewards program is one of the best loyalty programs run by a hotel chain. The Check-in experience was also exceptional, we landed our room directly without interacting with anyone which is something I never experienced before. no lines, no wait, went directly to an amazing room."
218,3.0,Parking Fee's ($18) and Resort Fees ($40) add another $58 per night to your budget.,"C'mon guys, the room was already higher than most.. another $58 bump in your nightly revenue? Room was very nice, Hotel lobby is very nice. Annoyed that people were allowed to smoke. Masking mandates loosely enforced.(okay with me) but was unsure when to mask and not"
219,5.0,"Great place to stay, play and eat.","Great place to stay, play and eat. We had an amazing view of the fountain. The parking had easy access to the casino and rooms. All the staff were amazing and the room were cleaned daily. Check in is easy with the MGM app. Will definitely be coming back soon."
220,5.0,Birthday getaway,Enjoyed a romantic birthday getaway with my fiance. It was his very first trip to Las Vegas and I wanted the experience to be nothing short of breathtaking and to set the standard for the first of many couples trip to be planned. This will definitely be our honeymoon destination in May of 2023
221,5.0,It’s the Bellagio!,I got what I expected. We received A class service. The food was excellent. The bed was so good. The room was clean and updated. I felt safe. I love the technology. You have to use your room card to get on the elevator. Make sure you are ready to walk. I will say the only thing that bothered me a tiny bit was the windows had dried water spots all over it. Other than that fantastic stay.
222,5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable and secure","Beautiful property in every way including check in experience, lobbies, and rooms.The beds were wonderful and the tower rooms are a great size. Great food and an overall sense of being safe guarded and cared about!"
223,2.0,Meh,"Staff lovely. Property overwhelming. Signage across the property is terrible - hard to find rooms, the right elevators, restaurants. Pricing at Lago was ridiculous for what was really barely adequate small plates of fokd."
224,5.0,Priceless Experience,"Best resort ever, rooms are spacious, staff attentive to customers specifics! Conference organizers and breakfast was great. The rooms came with a view and great supplies. Cleaned everyday and refreshed."
225,3.0,Upscale price but average service.,"Room 25115 was warm. After fixing it was making loud noise constantly so they transferred me to Room 26005. The shower has a strong water pressure which i like but it splashes water and created a paddle of water to the shower entrance and vanity area. I only had (1) bar soap, (1) body wash, (1) bath robe. No vanity kit, no shoe kit, no sleepers."
226,5.0,Excellent,This place was amazing. My wife and i had a awesome getaway just the two of us and boy o boy the cypress suit facing the strip room #7001 was on point. No only was the Las Vegas Blvd was at our overlook of the strip but the Water Fall Show was at our leisure right from our Bed. My very own bathroom and her very own bathroom all to ourselves. If you haven’t tried Bellagio then you haven’t tried living. A must do place.
227,5.0,Great stay,The staff was friendly and the room was great! The beds were super comfy and that view was amazing. The location was right in the middle of strip. Easy to walk to many other casinos. We will definitely be back.
228,5.0,Bellagio Heaven,"We had a wonderful time!!! Great service, friendly staff, awesome food. The room was beautiful!! Every moment was luxury. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the fountain view rooms!!"
229,1.0,Outdated,"The hotel is outdated. My suite was dark, bad lighting, and bad decor. Also the smell of overwhelming stale cigarette smoke was beyond gross in my room. Was with a large group celebrating my birthday. Disappointing also from random room charges.."
230,5.0,First Time Stay at the Bellagio,"This place won't disappoint - newly remodeled rooms, clean gym with lots of different equipment, great installations, good places to eat and courteous and professional staff. I highly recommend the Bellagio."
231,5.0,Exceptional,"We arrived early to have some pleasure time before the conference start. We had a great experience with the staff, amazing food in the banquet hall, and even had exceptional experience with in-room breakfast service."
232,5.0,Excellent Vegas stay,"Excellent service, clean and comfortable rooms, great food and amenity choices. All around, a great atmosphere. Location is centrally located on the strip, making it an easy walk to venture out to do some exploring. Highly recommended."
233,5.0,Full Recommendation,"My Colleges and I were very impress with all the service all the way around casino, restaurants, stores, all employees the best training they all are so helpful. your casino/property has my full recommendation to all my contacts"
234,1.0,Lied to in order to book a trip,"Was lied to by their VIP services to book a trip and convert points that didn’t exist. I’m out airfare and hotel costs and Didn’t get compensated at all, very disappointed by MGM and not how you should treat Platinum Loyalty guests."
235,3.0,Fountain view majestic,I advice to get a room with the fountain view so your stay will be worth it. There’s a mini fridge with stuff on it for sale and it’s pricy. It’s weight sensitive you get charge even if you don’t use it so watch out. It’s a trap. Don’t pick up anything for more than a minute you get charge. Linens & pillows are super white and soft to touch towels are big and extra absorbent. The king size bed is not what I expect just a bit bigger than the queen. The place is clean but there’s not a lot to do.
236,5.0,Excellent Bellagio stay!,"Great restaurants, awesome fitness center, great location, clean room, friendly staff. Plenty of lounges and slot machines. Easy and speedy checkin process. Great views of the Las Vegas Strip and famous fountains."
237,1.0,Wouldn’t stay again,"Casino is run down, staff is rude, hours are wrong on app, expensive. Rooms aren’t very nice. Better off doing air b n b plus they didn’t give me my $50 FB credit after I got a $22 bottle of water and $22 bag of nuts"
238,5.0,Bucket list hotel,Suprised wife with a weekend at her bucket list hotel. Room was magnificent and the view was astounding. Small issue with bathroom faucets was resolved immediately. Only real issue was soundproofing of the room. Any noise in the hallway was very loud in the room.
239,5.0,Bellagio review for January,We had a fantastic time at the bellagio the food was very good their staff was very attentive the decorations and the layout of the hotel was Beyond compare The bellagio is Is one of the only hotels I stay at in Vegas
240,1.0,Reminded me of HoJo’s,"Bellagio is past its prime. No longer consider this an upscale property. Room was supposedly renovated but was just okay. Service experienced was weak. Spago dinner was excellent, however. Plenty of better places available on the strip for the money."
241,5.0,"Bellagio is pricey, yet perfect.","This was not our first time at the Bellagio, and likely will not be our last. We have yet to encounter any significant issues when staying there; staff are always friendly, it is always very clean, and the rooms are beautiful (even more-so after the recent remodel). The only “complaint” we would have is that it is clearly a very expensive hotel/casino for people who have money and are perfectly okay with spending it. However, if you’re staying at the Bellagio, you get what you pay for."
242,5.0,Opulence in the heart of the strip!,"Came for a quick 3 night getaway with some friends. Everything we needed was right there. The rooms were clean, comfortable and very sound proof! A plus in Vegas! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Would go back in a heartbeat!"
243,5.0,Our Favorite,Bellagio has an independent atmosphere from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas. It just feels more relaxing. This is our go to home when we visit Las Vegas and always look forward to coming back. Thanks Bellagio
244,2.0,Below average,"Below average rooms for above average price. At least in the Spa tower. A few bad apples in the staff. Was treated as if I wasn’t wealthy enough to be there. Majority of staff very professional, dealers were excellent. Location of hotel is excellent."
245,5.0,Outstanding Service,Awesome experience for my womens retreat . We were treated like royalty. The staff was awesome. The meals were delicious and the ambiance in the hotels was very stunning. I love Bellagio and the dancing water falls are iconic please never get rid of them
246,5.0,Remodelled rooms,Amazing new furniture and the shower with the new closet space. We loved our stay! Thank you Bellagio!!! As always comfortable bed and the fountain view never gets old. We are coming back soon! Great job!!!
247,4.0,Walters adventure,"Was so disappointed in the food quality in Sadell’s. Many times we have stayed at Bellagio over the last 20 years and always perfect service and food, no matter the restaurant we chose. Not this trip. Buffet was old at 2:00 pm for lunch. Old being not fresh. Guess pandemic changes everything."
248,5.0,Love Bellagio❤️Great Location,Love the Bellagio Best Location Beautiful Hotel Modern rooms The Gardens are just Breathtaking 🌹🌹🌹Highly Recommended Fountains are Awesome too🙂 Best place to stay in Las Vegas centrally located A Very Special Place❤️
249,3.0,Reservation Fiasco,"Beautiful property yet untrained reservation staff unable to remedy their mixup with 3 booked rooms. It made it a constant aggravation, several long winded phone calls with no actual solution. So disappointed with that aspect of the trip. The facility is gorgeous yet the reservation service is decidedly lacking."
250,5.0,Bellagio January,"only a couple issues. big bird crap running down the window. 3 bathrooms but no coffee maker? no refrigerator, the remote controls to the tv worked in the living area but in the room the volume wouldn't work."
251,5.0,Luxury,"Such an amazing resort, the rooms are beautiful the beds are so comfortable and I loved the soaking tub.. the hotel staff was amazing and the conservatory was beautifully done for the Chinese New Year"
252,5.0,First class,We wanted to do Las Vegas in style the this hotel fit the bill. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and well appointed. The garden was also over the top “ Chinese New Year” stunning!
253,5.0,Great for business or pleasure,"It was a lot of fun. Pricey, but worth it. Only complaint was the cigarette smoke around the casino. If you are not a smoker it is terrible. Surprised there were kids around Vegas as well. I wouldn’t bring kids there. Really nothing for them to do."
254,4.0,Still Good But,"This is still a great place to stay, mostly because of the pool complex. However, staffing is obviously a huge problem. Also, Sadelle's is off our lit of go-to restaurants. It's just not the friendly, relaxed place the old Bellagio Cafe was; the menu is super limited, prices are crazy for certain items, and the general atmosphere is harried. The staff seems overwhelmed. Go to the Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn, 100% better."
255,5.0,Great winter getaway,"The Bellagio is still my favorite Strip property. We love the pool grounds. Even though it was never over 65 degrees outside, the pool was gloriously warm and sunny. Prices are quite high for food and beverages everywhere on property, but always tasty and served by friendly helpful staff. We failed in the casino this time but hope to be luckier next time. The casino host pleasantly softened the losses. Tip for meals; make a reservation for every one, there are long waits at some restaurants. Don’t forget to visit the garden display near the lobby. This time it was a stunning Year of the Tiger New Years display."
256,1.0,Rooms Dated > Wall Paper Peeling Off Wals,"Booked to stay for our daughter's 21st birthday. The room was not really clean, the wall paper was peeling off the wall in the bathroom Crazy they would allow a room to be rented when it was so damaged and seemly easy to repair. $260 per night and I suspect a Motel six would be maybe more clean."
257,5.0,Bellagio Resort,"We have been going to the Bellagio Resort since their Grand Opening many years ago. Every year we go there at least once for our mini vacation. Bellagio has the very best location. The deco is wonderful, staff is professional and helpful, and the accommodations are the best overall."
258,3.0,Been here before and was great. This time was disappointing.,"Check in was delayed more than three hours and were not compensated for the inconvenience. I understand that there are widespread staffing issues and I sympathize with this, however, not making an effort to somehow make it up to us was disappointing. On top of that some additional charges were made that were not ours."
259,3.0,You expect more from the Bellagio,"I had a fountain view suite. The water pressure in the shower was terrible, in part bc the shower head was clogged. The tv and other technology was old. No streaming services, limited options, just old."
260,2.0,Dusty Linens,Had a very hard time sleeping due to allergies caused by dusty bed linens. Sheets were changed but left the pillows which were just as dusty. The room also had an “old” odor to it. Not to mention that upon check out there was an issue and we almost missed out reservation at Hells Kitchen.
261,5.0,"Great hotel, great location","We had booked into Sloan Suite Strip view - originally our room was on the far corner of the hotel and some of our windows were overlooking back of Aria Hotel - given it was the back of the other hotel, delivery trucks, bin collection was quite noisy and the noise kept on waking us up. After first night, we went down to the reception and the lady happily and promptly changed our room which was great. The hotel itself has loads to do within it, it has many great restaurants and bars, entertainment, spa, pools and casino tables/slots. The hotel looks well kept and in good condition. I believe rooms are being refurbished as well and the newly refurbished rooms can be booked via their website. It also has perfect location on the strip and stellar reputation, that itself would make"
262,2.0,Been going the Bellagio for 19 years,It has become a corporate style resort. Poor ventilation in the casino. Smelled like cigarette smoke throughout the casino. M Life program is poor. Not the Bellagio it was. Car service was poor due to the time it took to get. I decided one night to go to the Wynn and check it out. My next trip is going to be there.
263,5.0,Our return to the Bellagio,"We chose to return to the Bellagio again because in our view it is an excellent property for many reasons. Well located for shows that are playing and shopping. A short walk to many. Security comes to mind, a room key is required to enter the elevator hallway and inside the elevator to access your floor. Apparently some think it is an annoying feature? We feel it is a great feature. Our early arrival flight meant we were in the check in gold /platinum line at 12 noon, check in is of course 3pm. No problem for the helpful staff member who offered us three options including an immediate occupancy of a fountain view room on the 14th floor. The room we had booked was not a fountain view room. A nice upgrade at no extra charge. The two queen sized beds were very comfortable and the"
264,4.0,2nd stay was awesome,"I have been twice and loved it each time. The bedding is so comfortable, rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff didn’t inform me of the complete hold on my card for incidentals, and as such the lower score due to that inconvenience. But everything else was great."
265,3.0,Better than Caesars properties/Hotels but still cheaper than others.,"My first time staying at Bellagio. The regular rooms are average at best and has a smell. Even the Harrah's remodeled rooms are better than the remodeled rooms here. The overall experience is definitely better than all of Caesars Hotels. It doesn't matter how much you lose you don't get any comps at any Caesars properties. Bellagio gives you a suite and food comp for playing a lot. They don't give you more than $500 in food and no free play. My biggest complaint is that they are super stingy with their drinks. I could sit at any high roller machine at Cosmo to get Mac 18 and Blue label. Bellagio has a policy to not offer you higher end alcohol because it's against their policy. My win/loss statement shows $85,000 going in on slots, table, games, roulette..etc I would be offered"
266,2.0,Poor communication,"I had an issue and every staff member I talked to, pushed me to a different department. At one point I was in the phone for a hour to try to figure out the situation. The membership has no perks, my simplest issue wasn’t a big deal. I felt looked down, because I was suppose to have comp nights stay. I found some used shampoo containers in the shower so I questioned if the room was actually Cleaned. Before hand"
267,4.0,"Beautiful, but average experience.","I don’t normally splurge on a hotel, but it was my mom’s birthday so I went for it. Booked a Stay Well room that was beautifully remodeled, but walked in to the bathroom for the first time to find hair all over the sinks. Service was consistently annoying during the trip. The gorgeous view from our room helped."
268,4.0,First couples visit to the strip,"The architecture of this resort, the staff and the on-site amenities are amazing! Never had a bad meal no matter the restaurant. The check in and out was smooth and simple. The only real negative was the room. Which wasn't that clean, had something on the wall behind the bed (didn't want to look too closely), no bathroom trash can, no bathroom fan and no medium weight blanket (either too hot or too cold)."
269,5.0,Step above,"The resort is amazing, the location puts you right in the middle of the strip making it so convenient to get to anything. We had dinner at the Mayfair, it was outstanding. I would highly recommend this dinning experience!"
270,3.0,"Use to be alot better, china is winning!","I'm sure this won't get read but here we go. We booked a room through AMEX travel and got a room in the spa tower all the way towards the back of the hallway. Room had food in the fridge and personal items were left in the room from prior guests. We checked in online prior to arrival and through the app. When we got dropped off no customer service saying ""Welcome to the Bellagio"" or anything as we walked 1.2 miles with suitcases to our room. We had 4 guests, 2 room on different floors. Casino was clean and fun. Room service and front desk sounded like they didn't want to talk to anyone. Spa never answered phones during business hours. It was an ok trip but wouldn't stay here again. I can tell the shift has moved to 1 company buying all the hotels while others shift"
271,5.0,Fantastic honeymoon experience.,Had a fountain view that was to die for. Customers were raving how they ate here or they stood there and watched the breathless fountains. All we had to do was open our curtains and turn our TV to the music that matched the fountain display.
272,5.0,Seamless,"From initial reservations for hotel, entertainment and dining to check-in, concierge services and check-out the experience was seamless. Food was excellent - ""O"" was stunning. And, of course, the fountains are extraordinary."
273,3.0,First and Last,"Although there were a couple of problems on the one day I spent at Bellagio. I wouldn't discourage someone from spending time here. I personally may not return, but there has to be reasons that others do. First impressions are lasting impressions. I've been wanting to stay here for many years and it just didn't size up to my expectations. Great customer service."
274,5.0,Second to None,On our most recent trip to Vegas we stayed at the Bellagio which is in the best location...The miracle mile mall is across the street with some of the best places to eat....The Bellagio pool is Gigantic and has Several Jacuzzis with many cabana for rent....The whole place inside and out has a million dollar feel and the customer service is Excellent...Our room was large with 2 beds and a shower the size of most home bathrooms...Will Definitely stay at Bellagio on our next visit.
275,2.0,Where reality falls far short of expectations,"So we had booked vegas for my 40th birthday but due to Covid it got put back a year No trouble completely understand this So eventually we qre booked into the Bellagio and take a not short trip over the pond for a 10 hour flight to Vegas and the Bellagio We turn up and first impressions seem good Open hotel, nicely presented, clean welcoming One minor issue for most but a huge issue if your disabled is that they simply did not have anywhere near enough people to book people in So your stood waiting in a queue for an eternity with no seats which as I am disabled and have trouble standing was a very painful experience. So we get to to room floor 26, lovely view over the freeway (not) but the room was clean, spacious and well presented. Bathroom was nice and the bed comfy."
276,5.0,Very clean,"Every hotel we’ve stayed in here has had some cosmetic eye sores or dirty qualities, not Bellagio! A great place to sleep with a super comfortable bed and deep tub! I really could not have asked for a better room, other than the tv not having applications like Netflix."
277,2.0,Bellagio is in need of a shakeup,"The reservation was lost, replaced, repriced and relocated. The toilet was not clean and the room was not attended to for the first 2 days. Checkin guy was a little testy and distant. If I wasn’t so tired I would have cancelled and walked over to the Cosmopolitan. I never received a credit from the first reservation deposit or the checkout account statement. The elevator conditions were filthy. But, the Asian lady in the Atrium restaurant and the valet guys were great."
278,5.0,Outstanding,"No reason to stay anywhere on the Strip other than the Bellagio. The rooms, restaurants, air ventilation, beverage servers, etc. The bedding was amazing. Soft pillows, soft sheets, and an AMAZING shower that could fit four people!!! Room was overlooking the water display,"
279,4.0,Service nightmare,"Just some mistakes that were made that just makes you feel like your really not that important. The Bell desk ,design and location is the strongest asset here. Will I think the staff means well they just aren’t trained correctly."
280,3.0,Beautiful resort. Ridiculous 'resort fees'. All it includes is the gym and wifi. WTH.,The resort fees are really getting out of control. $45 that includes wifi and the gym. That's all. Oh yes and 'we print your boarding pass'. Does anyone use that? What if you don't use the gym? Wifi is not worth $45 a day.
281,5.0,No place better in the Strip,Self Contained. Never need to leave this world class property. unbelievable diverse restaurant choices. Amazing Garden area with brilliant artistic design. Solid workout facility in Spa. Bar and food service personnel friendly professional and caring.
282,5.0,Trip Advisor,"Fabulous service from the time we arrived with the valet service. The check-in person was friendly, relaxed and committed to finding the best room for our range. The room was gorgeous with great view of Bellagio fountains. Excellent food and entertainment! Good value. Very satisfying."
283,5.0,Outstanding Facility and Experience,"The facility is one of the best in Vegas with the shops, entertainment an outstanding dining. However, the best part was the staff, they were clearly excited to assist our group and they were all kind and appreciative of the business we were providing."
284,3.0,Over rated,"Rooms were outdated, spa was expensive, overall wasn’t worth it. Didn’t feel it was worth that money. Wynn encore and aria are nicer if you plan to book a stay in vegas. I feel like all the mgm affiliates charge parking fee which is just robbery given the fact it cost $300-400 a night and the sports betting was mediocre. Just no value in it"
285,5.0,Beautiful Stay,"1st time stay at Bellagio and a long time coming. Hotel is beautiful. Rooms were huge. Fountain view was gorgeous. Food was excellent. Well worth the cost, you get your value. Centrally located and wasn't too far of a walk to a lot of places we wanted to go to."
286,5.0,Great stay!,We had a great stay at the Bellagio!! We were pampered our entire stay. The staff was very friendly and offered help anytime we ask. The mobile check in experience was easy. Plenty of food options. This was our 3rd trip to Vegas and the first time at Bellagio. I will never stay anywhere else! The Bellagio is my new Vegas home when I visit!
287,5.0,Great hotel,"Great, beautiful hotel. Clean room. Great view. Centrally located on the main strip. Within walking distance of many other casinos and restaurants. Tram located behind the casino made a quick trip down to the Park MGM."
288,2.0,Very Bad Sewer smell outside and inside the roon on the first night and bad service in Noodles,"Staff did not take the initiative to keep the guest satisfied. It was always trying to make you feel obligated and uneasy. Only the maid next day morning took good care by replacing the sheets and supplies. I would fix the restaurant service in Noodles, we ate in the cafe and the Mayfair, the service was the best there."
289,5.0,Weekend Trip for Wedding,Stayed at Bellagio for two nights to attend a wedding. Pre check-in through the phone was simple and easy. Also using your phone as the keycard to enter the elevator and rooms was also convenient. Bellagio poker room was also very nice.
290,5.0,My Birthday Celebration.,"My experience was like one I couldn't imagine. The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating, hw went above and beyond our expectation to make sure that my birthday stay will be enjoyable. I could not expect anything more from his hospitality. I have decided to bring along out children Easter to share our enjoyment. I have made reservation for two rooms for the Easter holiday weekend."
291,5.0,Great Stay,"Our stay was great, I would have to say the best part was how willing the staff was to assist with any issues we had or locating anything around the property. It was really appreciated. The primary reason I would choose this property again is because of the location it's close to the heart of the strip and has most of the amenities you are looking for."
292,2.0,Go somewhere else,"Whatever you do, do not go to the buffet, worst food in Vegas! For the price that they charge here, you can go down the street and get a comparable room for a much better price. Overall, very disappointed."
293,5.0,CES AND BELLAGIO,Very clean. Great ces experience. Wife enjoyed our 4 nights. Restaurants were great. Gambling was fun and shopping was an adventure. Will be back for CES next year. 26th floor was remodeled and was a great choice when my wife upgraded our stay.
294,5.0,"Enjoyable, good surroundings, exquisite place!!","2nd time we stayed at Bellagio and we enjoyed our stay, nice and accommodating staff , friendly with a great smiles!!great food and nice view!!! The rooms are good for the three of us!! We will come back again and again!!!"
295,5.0,Love bellagio,"Love it. Always stay at bellagio when I'm in town . Got the greatest host .. the food is great and delicious. Shopping and wonderful too, all the high end shops is inside. Will always be back to celebrate"
296,5.0,Best service Best staff,Everyone and Everything was spectacular. It was a fantastic trip for all involved and we couldn’t ask for a better Resort. It had been a few years since we were last in Vegas but will be going back soon. It was a 20 out of 10
297,5.0,Classy,"The Bellagio is a classical beauty to behold. We stayed at the Bellagio for five nights and I am so grateful for the experience. Check-in was a breeze and the staff was very attentive our entire visit. The hotel lobby was beautifully kept and the piano playing was very soothing. I was extremely impressed with their displays for the Chinese Lunar New Year; they were elegant and very refined. Our room had a view of the Bellagio Fountains and it was such a treat to enjoy these fountains every night from our window. The room was beautifully kept as well; the shower had great pressure, the robes were very soft, and the beds were maintained very well. It is expensive to gamble and shop at the casino but we had this expectation going into our stay, so we did elect to gamble and shop"
298,5.0,Best trip ever!!!!,"Top notch accommodations and services. could not have asked for a better stay. All the restaurants were amazing, staff were super sweet and helpful and the weather was perfect. Loved everything about our stay."
299,5.0,Luxurious Staple on the Strip,"We have been staying at the Bellagio for years, occasionally alternating amongst other MGM properties. We keep coming back to Bellagio. The pools are great, rooms attractive and clean, service top notch. Worth a splurge!"
300,5.0,Bellagio is an awesome place to stay!,Bellagio is a beautiful place to stay! (Beds are awesome!). We had a fountain view room. What a beautiful view of the fountains! Very comfy room. Also love going to the conservatory! It is so beautiful every time I visit! Never disappointed!
301,5.0,Exceptional Service,"From the time we got off the airplane, the VIP services treated us with style and service. Each reservation was exceptional and the show was spectacular. The Spa did a great job with the updo for dinner and the suite provided views that made the evening glorious."
302,2.0,A terrific below average resort,The check in host was the best part of this stay. The casino dealers were some of the worst I have ever seen and I have been coming to vegas in a gambling capacity for decades. I honestly don't think I saw one dealer smile in 5 days. If you expect comps for your play I would look elsewhere. My money would be put to better use elsewhere.
303,5.0,BELLAGIO IS EXCEPTIONAL,"Exceptional, This visit we got married. All our accommodations were wonderful. Jasmine was great as our choice for dinner. Jennifer the Mgr was terrific and a great help for selections. Service 5 star."
304,3.0,Not what it used to be,Great location. Fountains are excellent. But the rooms were dated and my view of the strip from the spa building was a view mostly of a parking lot. Don’t stay in the spa building. It’s out of the way and very inconvenient. I was here yrs ago and it feels like the hotel has slipped down a few notches. Buffett was very weak for $70.
305,4.0,Don t get in room snacks,$17 for a two dollar bag of chips. I understand the convenience of the in room snacks but that markup is absolutely ridiculous. That just made the whole experience not excellent. Seriously they have to charge that much when they’re taking your money gambling
306,5.0,Wanderer's January 2022 Review,"Great stay, our first in 10 years. Bellagio is still the great place we remembered. Hard to believe that it's more than 20 years old. Excellent fountain view room. Staff was great. Didn't even lose money in the casino!"
307,1.0,BEWARE,"We have stayed at the Bellagio twice a year for the last 5 years. When they removed the bath tubs from the fountain view rooms, we decided to upgrade to a suite. The suite was terrible. The couch was covered in stains, the furniture was beat up, the shower head was broken, and the view was pretty lame. I would highly recommend NOT booking a ""nicer"" room. I would recommend checking out another hotel altogether. The Bellagio has gone downhill"
308,4.0,Christmas decorations galore,"Great place to go if you like Christmas decorations. I loved every bit and all the details. Everything is larger than life and lots to see. The polar bears were probably my favorite, along with the Christmas trees. If you have a chance to go and love Christmas decorations like I do, then this is the place to go!"
309,5.0,Steve Wynn Legend Lives On,"We experienced the Bellagio when it first opened in 1988, very special then. The conservatory was one of the highlights and drew so many visitors, we actually stopped coming due to the crowds. When ARIA opened, we loved that instead. But ARIA has gone down hill (they just renovated their Sky Suites) with mediocre service and amenities so we tried Bellagio again. WOW, the Steve Wynn legend lives on. Our suite was decent and certainly not like ARIA but very functional. Master bath is actually two bathrooms, one with shower and one with bath. A third bathroom in the living room area. Hint: We had a lake view but on weekends, the night club across the street plays very loud music 11:00PM to 2AM and you can hear it. Very annoying. Book pool side suite if you want to avoid."
310,5.0,I love the Bellagio,Front desk staff was always helpful. The cleaning staff was always so friendly. The hotel room was always extremely clean when we got back to our room. I’m pretty sure I won’t be able to ever stay anywhere else in Vegas! Love the Bellagio!
311,5.0,Bday,"The hotel is very beautiful and our room had a grand view of the fountain. The restaurants were nice but I believe to be overpriced. We saw the O show, and it was great. However, I have to say more attention to cleanliness of the rooms is needed."
312,5.0,Las Vegas January 2022,The hotel is amazing and all in all I have the highest regards for what Bellagio represents. I have but only the nicest memories for the luxury held within the property and would recomend it to everyone.
313,5.0,Still splendid after all these years,"The hotel is gorgeous as always, restaurants are top flight, service is impeccable. There is nothing not to like. We love returning to the Bellagio. Every visit is just as special as the one before. The staff throughout the hotel are incredible. Just overall excellent."
314,5.0,Incredible stay!,"The room was impeccably clean, beds and pillows were comfortable. Staff was always so friendly and helpful. Everyone was so happy! We had a fantastic stay, we were so comfortable and felt at home. Really didn't even need to leave the hotel!"
315,3.0,Upgraded room and experience was just OK.,"Stayed in a King Suite with Strip Views. Happy about being able to have the room earlier, but the overall details for an upgraded experience were missing. No robes, not sure if floor around toilet was even cleaned, comforter put on backwards. Old room service left out in hall for over half a day. Could not, for the life of me get a staff person to clearly and patiently show me where the darned elevators were to the rooms. Meh, will try other hotels."
316,1.0,Want to wait 2 hours in the lobby? Try this hotel.,"Girls at the concierge rude and irresponsible . Lost an item in room, took 2 hours to retrieve it. The girl at the concierge ask me to step aside and “wait for security” without telling me to call lost and found first. Waited 30 mins for nothing and called, took forever for them to pick up phone. Waited another hour for them to “find” my item in their back room and the fact was they were shifting people and no one actually went to look for my item! Horrible customer service will never stay again."
317,5.0,Beautiful suite with a view of the fountains!,Beautiful suite with a view of the fountains! Will definitely return soon. Everything from the food to the property was great. Slots were very tight but a quick tram ride and we were able to play longer.
318,5.0,Never a disappointment,"The best location and hotel on the strip. Definitely get a view of the fountains. The restaurants are very pricey, but so are all the good restaurants in Vegas. Bellagio has everything, but I do miss the lovely woman clothing store near the main elevators. They need to bring this shop back."
319,5.0,They go above and beyond with service.,"This is one of the best vacations I’ve been on. I think the casino need more waiting staff for the casino since it would take us an hour for getting a drink. I would go buy my own and go up to our room to make a drink for my wife and I. Tried other routs going to other sections being told to set down, did that and played for longer and was still avoided. Went to the bar after that and quit gambling since we wanted to relax after walking 6 miles each day. Overall I still love this place and will prepare more when I come next. 30 min is my cut off time if I’ve spent $100 and I want a drink someone should be around helping out. Game service didn’t help and said someone was working that section."
320,2.0,Noisy,"Every time a hotel rooms door would close in my hallway, there was a loud slamming noise. I’ve never experienced any kind of noise like this in any Las Vegas hotels. I was awakening every night I stayed, several times"
321,2.0,First and last time here,First time staying at Bellagio. Room positioning poor- booking was done directly with Bellagio and the view was of back parking lot. Room was above nightclub and loud music could be heard throughout the night that was disruptive and unwelcome. When staff were notified of concern they were dismissive and bothered by our presence. Felt unsafe as room was tried to get into while inside alone and when they were walking away were heard saying 'I saw her go this way'. Overall bad experience that left me feeling jolted and in a jeopardizing position. I would not recommend Bellagio and would go so far as to deter others from staying by bringing up personal experience if brought up in conversation.
322,1.0,Not Worth It,"Horrible check-in that involved the MGM App that doesn't work, poor to average rooms. Very little to no food options that don't involve a reservation after 5pm like Cosmo or Caesars. Trying to find food options on the MGM app that includes all the other MGM properties is a beating. Yes I know there is a filter, but having to use a filter to find a restaurant at the resort I am at is stupid. Not worth the hype."
323,3.0,"For the price, I would rather go to the Wynn","First time in Vegas and was excited to stay at the Bellagio... come on it was in Ocean's 11. Anyways the only consistent staff was the cleaning ladies, other than that the front staff was short and not very friendly. The hotel space was nice. The room service took longer than expected and when it came to the room it was spilled all over the bag it came in. In all honesty, if I did Vegas again, I will be going to the Wynn, we went for dinner and the staff we met on the way to the restaurant was nicer and more cordial than most of the staff I encountered in my 2-3 days stay at the Bellagio. For the price I expected a bit better service."
324,5.0,Excellent Stay at an Excellent Resort!,"Just came back from a 6 day trip to Vegas and the Bellagio was my home resort. I looked forward to staying there and it did not disappoint! Lobby was beautiful and the room even more so with excellent views of the fountains and the Strip. Watching the show from my room with the television on the ""Fountains of Bellagio"" channel is a memory that will be with me forever. Staff was very friendly, the Tutto main store was conveniently located across from the elevators. A five star stay for sure!"
325,5.0,Bellagio,The Bellagio was a great place to stay. Our room was clean and the bed was really comfortable which is hard to find! Being right in the middle of the strip was great with everything in good walking distance. We loved the Bellagio!
326,3.0,Mediocre,"I realize covid has had an impact on hospitality however when you visit a place that is known for greatness, it's hard to lower your expectations. Mainly the food options, open hours and quality of food. I was disappointed with Sadelles ribeye steak...awful and bland. The hotel buffet $100 for 2 was only open 8 am to 3 pm. The variety of food was good but the quality was not. The beef, turkey and chicken from the carving station was awful...dry and hard as rock. Lastly...no where to eat late night....this is vegas right? As for the low service score...most the service I received was very good...just not enough available. I have traveled to Vegas over 15 times and usually stay at Mandalay.."
327,2.0,Nothing special.,My experience with The Bellagio was nothing special. I was highly disappointed. I was told this was the most Elite place to stay and boy it never felt that way at all. Our room got cleaned one time in the 4 days we were there. They said our room was not ready that we would have to wait and it wasn't even that busy. Stay somewhere else for the money you would spend here.
328,1.0,Don't plan on going to sleep until 3:00am when music across street is done,"It may be beautiful, but that's about all. The service is terrible, not 5 star at all. The hotel room itself lights went out and then drapery didn't work. Couldn't fall asleep until 2:30 am for several nights because of the base/extremely loud music coming from the ""rave club"" across the street. Plus you can hear every person walking down the hall and your neighbors in the rooms next door as well. Really crummy. Manager said ""that's just the way it is, it's the strip."" Really, well I won't be back. I would like a good night's rest."
329,5.0,Beautiful Ambiance,"Our very first but definitely not our last time staying here. It felt like a life of luxury & exuberance!!! From the check-in experience, to check-out, it was a seamless, fast process. Would definitely recommend!"
330,5.0,Excellent,"A very high quality experience, experienced and professional staff, unique designs and architecture, Everything at the highest standards. I will totally rebook in the future and recommend the place to all people I know"
331,3.0,First time at Bellagio. Less than impressed.,"Booked a Cypress Suite months in advance with a request for a high floor to see the fountains. Arrived and could only get on Floor 6. They offered a Penthouse Suite (no bigger than Cypress sqare footage, but on the mountain side). I wasn't interested. Also, Housekeeping came in one day despite the do not disturb light being on. I wasn't even offered something as simple as free parking for my stay."
332,5.0,Family trip,"The hotel was clean and hospitable. The gardens for Chinese New Year were amazing. We tried Sadelle and Noodles for dining. Both were just wonderful. Only one pool was open, because the others were being redone. That was about the only thing a little disappointing. Otherwise our stay was fantastic."
333,5.0,It’s the Bellagio shall I say more?,"One of the best hotels in Vegas that still have that Vegas feel even after the pandemic, the staff is always accommodating. We went here with kids and they had so much fun, it’s great because of the location and the fountain rooms are so worth it."
334,2.0,Plan for worse,"Don’t go by what was promised on the phone. Book whatever you want and love with the choice you make, not what is promised. Upon checkin I was told not to worry I would be able to purchase a paid upgrade when I arrive for a room with a fountain view. This was not the case. Face to face this is not possible."
335,5.0,My stay at Bellagio,"I'm a Mlife Platinum card holder. My reservations were done thru VIP. When I went to check in the people behind the counter ignored me, then looked down their nose at me and would you believe their computer would not allow them to check me in thru VIP so I was told I had to check in with everyone else out at the lobby desk. Ok, no big deal, there are bigger problems in the world. It's just being looked at like I'm invisible and not worthy to be spoken to. That's what gets me. The room was extremely clean. My hats off to cleaning service. Room service was faster than they said they would be. Loved that. I never thought I would pay $5 for a Dr. Pepper. All in all if you are the type of person that looks down your nose at people and think you're better than others, this is"
336,5.0,Star Forever,"Bellagio has stayed the best of Vegas especially during the pandemic. It always renewed itself and did not let itself have tired look. It has great restaurants (Michael Mina, Lago), legendary decorations at the observatory, classic but timeless, the rooms are fresh, love the pillows."
337,5.0,Circus Soleil O,"Circus Soleil O is a must see show. Outstanding. The skill of the performers is amazing. Humorous, fascinating, jaw dropping, worth the money. Action is constandly going on. Even between acts, they keep you entertained. Don't miss it."
338,4.0,World of Concrete Trip,We had issues while checking in and with the rooms keys. Had to visit reception a couple times and unfortunately both times were not quick. The location amenities and decor of the hotel are amazing. I would stay here again and hope the check in process is a lot better.
339,5.0,Great rooms. Great location,"Great rooms. Pillows were lumpy and bed was ripped. Other than that, it was Excellent service. They gave my mother champagne and strawberries for her birthday. Such an amazing gesture. I loved Prime for dinner by the fountains as well. It was worth every penny. Great employees. Loved my stay."
340,5.0,Lux Vegas,Everything about my stay was ridiculously luxurious. I had the best time visiting the shops and especially the restaurants. The Fountains are an unprecedented beauty! I spent a lot of time in the Botanical Garden and was thrilled to see the flower assembly process.
341,2.0,Not the Best Experience,"Unprofessional, racially profiled, unclean and unsanitized rooms, foul odor in room, ice container was dirty, small marks on bedding, no in room dining accommodations such as microwave and refrigerator. The refrigerator was stocked with overpriced alcoholic beverages and other drinks. I was shocked and disappointed."
342,2.0,Going down hill fast.,"We are M life members and have stayed at this property year after year but we won't be staying here again. We know Covid has hit hotels in Vegas hard, however there are some things there are simply NO excuse for. Like the lack of clean bathrooms in the Casino! The bathrooms near the Poker room were disgusting! Every stall had ""Something"" in it and were FILTHY. Sadly, I'm talking about the Women's bathroom! I heard the men's rooms were worse, if that's possible! The other problem, Lack of customer service. I guess picking up the phone or calling people back at the Spa was just too much? You could be on hold for 30 minutes, nobody would pick up, you could leave a voice mail, a day later no call back, so booking a service was not going to happen and if you had a"
343,4.0,Bellagio is still the Best,We had a wonderful time at the beautiful as always Bellagio. Food was really good at all of the restaurants on property. Our suite was awesome even though we had to upgrade to get it. I usually get it comped. They have really changed their rules on comping. I played several thousand dollars and got very little for it. But we still love the Bellagio.
344,5.0,Beautiful property and the food was great!,"Everything was great ! The food was superb! I Will be back soon and I Will let My friends and Family know to come and Experience this hotel and all it offers, from the moment the valet greets you, to all the maids in the hallways, the staff at the breakfast bar , you can tell everyone is happy to work here!"
345,5.0,Great!,"Best hotel we’ve stayed at on the strip, staff was great at making our stay memorable an amazing from beginning to end.They made sure we was well accommodated an had everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. Will be returning."
346,5.0,Wow factor!,"Haven’t been to Vegas in 28 years. The Bellagio did not disappoint! Amazing everything! The details to attention from the flowers to the room to the casino, the employees were outstanding, Perfect stay."
347,5.0,Another great stay at the Bellagio,"Located at the heart of the strip. Nice staff in the casino. We loved the check in and out without waiting in the lines. Yellow tail restaurant was a great experience, food was creative and fresh. Will stay there again next time"
348,5.0,Very elegant.,The room was very nice and clean. It had a very relaxing atmosphere. It was quiet in the room. It was easy to check in and out online. We love the keyless entry...use phone to unlock the room. Room service was great and it was available 24/7
349,5.0,Great views,Fountain view rooms are the way to go. Make sure you get the main tower for best views. Checkin ahead of time using the phone app and use the app electronic key to avoid the long Checkin line. Same with parking. Use the app and electronic parking pass.
350,3.0,Nice hotel but not great,"Nice hotel and rooms were good but no coffee machine or complementary water. Overall, an okay view of the strip but nothing special - was expecting a better view. The design of the room was nice and sleep was good"
351,1.0,Not worth it to stay,I had bad experience at saddle restaurant for breakfast. We were moved 3 times because the table was reserved. We were offered a tiny table for 6 people The manager simply told us take it or leave it . We ended up going back to the line and wait. After all we sat on two separate tables
352,1.0,WAY too expensive for lack of amenities,"No coffee maker in room, no access to refrigerator or microwave. Next door patrons partied loudly until 3 am, and as a single woman in the room next door did not feel safe calling to complain. (I had my white noise on high and pillows on either side of head.) Only amenity in room that was different than a motel was a robe."
353,5.0,Still great!,"As much as Las Vegas continues to change and evolve, one steady constant is the Bellagio, which may be better post-pandemic than some of its competitors (Encore, Wynn). We felt like were actually in Las Vegas, not a glass and steel condo that offers gambling. A lot of features are still off, but a lot aren't. And the price for our room - Penthouse Suite level - was a bargain. We'll be back, and soon."
354,3.0,Resort fees and upsell at checkin is outrageous,"There were not 5 star perks for the 5 star price. The bathroom ceiling was cracked and bubbled, there was no Vegas tourism /explore Vegas offers or booklets, these are standard offers and free at 3 and 4 star hotels, we didn't know until the 3rd day of cleaning we had been missing body wash in our bathroom samplings, and a Vegas daily magazine, half our snack shelf was already empty and never filled, the same straw and wrapper were infront of our door the full 5 days and with Covid who wants totouch that, not to mention if a simple straw isn't vacuumed up how clean are they cleaning the hallways?? . it just didn't seem like the hotel service matched the price, the snack shop was $52 for a slice of pizza, and a order of chicken tenders, 2 fries and 2 drinks.

355,5.0,WOW Bellagio,"You wont get the hype until you stay at the Bellagio. We stayed 3 nights and the Casino was popping every night. The Mayfair Supper Club has it all. Amazing food, and an immersive show that you have to see to believe. Its way better than the videos on youtube. Sit in front, thank me later #yolo."
356,3.0,I already explained that we called to be moved because of the horrible mildew and mold on the Bellagio tower 27th floor,I already explained that the Bellagio tower 27th floor near room 270083. They cleaned carpet and placed a fan near room. The fan exposed a the mold behind a flapping piece of wallpaper. We asked to be moved and they offered a small room at same price. Not cool
357,4.0,Birthday Trip,Great location! Awesome fountain view room! Very clean! Great welcome by front desk team! Loved having Starbucks onsight Great massages onsite at the Salon and Spa! Would recommend getting a massage onsite!
358,2.0,Tired and lost,"Once the queen of the strip, the Bellagio has not only seen better days, the staff seems like they’d rather be elsewhere too. We stayed in one of the top rooms that was furnished with outdated pieces and had very little of the technology found in every other hotel room in the world. As for the staff, they couldn’t have cared less. In our three nights housekeeping only showed up once at 6PM and then left the door wide open when they left. When I called on the only phone that worked in the room, they said they were too busy cleaning the rooms for guests checking in and wouldn’t be doing any of the other rooms."
359,5.0,Centrally located,Beautiful stay at the best centrally located hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Self parking is slightly confusing but the roOm service was delicious. The water show is an easy attraction. Buffet has great choices and easily pleased the children.
360,2.0,Service was Horrendous,"Brought my staff of 5 down to Vegas for the world of concrete show. Really bad service from the start. I'm not sure what kind of hotel software they are using but It can barely find a name without taking 20 minutes. We we're all switched rooms after 1 night to another section of the hotel. The staff had asked for us to leave our bags in the room until our new room was ready. Little did we know our keys room keys we're deactivated by 9am. When I received notification that our new room was ready, we went to get our bags and we're locked out. We called the front desk ands they gave us attitude then said they would send someone up to help. We sat on the floor outside the door of our rooms for 45 minutes. I missed a critical business meeting that likely cost me $10 000."
361,5.0,Three-Day Holiday,"The hotel is beautiful, clean, and nicely furnished. We had an awesome view of the fountains, which we never tired of watching while in the room and when not occupied with other activities.... The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. No hesitation in recommending the Bellagio!"
362,4.0,Great Value,The overall hotel stay was great. the restaurant options are excellent and the staff is very attentive. The property is centrally located so you could walk to the most prominent hotels and shops in the area.
363,5.0,Great experience.,The hotel was immaculate. All employees were very helpful and kind. Hotel conservatory was just beautiful . It was decorated with so many wonderful characters and foliage.Such a different way to spend some time relaxing.
364,3.0,Quick weekend at Bellagio,This was about the 20th time we stayed here but there were a lot of shortfalls for this stay at the Bellagio. See my pros and cons noted: Pros: • location is fantastic • price-got a fountain view room for $86 through mlife excluding tax and resort fees • size of the room was large and spacious • service was top notch • variety of eateries at different price scales • room was clean • fountain view was beautiful Cons • TV in room didn’t work • glass windows were filthy and spoiled the view of the room and fountain view • no weight scale in the bathroom • no bathroom heater as should have one at a high end resort • the room spelled of smoke even though we booked a non-smoking room • no mask/sanitizer package in room like previous times Great hotel but they need to improve
365,3.0,You dont get what you paid for. Everything is pricey!,"We were disappointed that there was no coffee maker or microwave inside the room. We think that we did not get what we paid for, everything is pricey, even a bottle of water cost $12 per bottle. Guards who are stationed in the guest's elevator always ask us for our keycard. It is like profiling us since they never ask the others who were also there, only us! Customer service has gone down. We will not recommend this hotel to our family and friends."
366,2.0,Nothing out of the ordinary for Las Vegas.,"There were other, nicer… newer… smoke free hotels we toured that we will stay at on our next visit. Being forced to walk through the smoke filled casino on our way to and from the elevators was disgusting!"
367,2.0,Little disappointed,I was charged high fee on incidentals without any explanation after I checked out. Be aware of this while staying here. Rest of the experience was great. If someone from bellagio resolves- I am happy to change the review.
368,2.0,MS,"When Steve Wynn owned Bellagio, we felt like valued guests. This time we felt like we were there to increase MGM's profits. And the rooms were ho hum. We really disliked the two new restaurants Lago and Spago. Lago was way too noisy, and Spago's music was insanely loud."
369,3.0,Expected more,Don’t get me wrong Bellagio is a beautiful hotel but overall staff organization as well as room amenities need to be upgraded. Such as a/c & shower. Very nice casino and a lot of entertainment like the beautiful garden inside.
370,3.0,"Wonderful Staff.. bad air filters, cigar, cigarette smoke permeated my hair & clothes","The property is beautiful and the staff very kind. I think because of Covid room service was not fully operating, so we missed a hot meal past 9PM. The room service operator was not very helpful in suggesting where we could get a hot meal on property.. We had to figure that out ourselves. Unfortunately the air filters in the lobby, casino and public areas was subpar. The air permeated my hair and clothes with cigar and cigarette smoke and I could not stay long in the property. We walked to the Aria where friends were staying and it was fresh and clean and smelled good so their air filters must be superior. I wondered if the air filters were not working at all at the Bellago, which was cause for additional concern with Covid Omicron running rampant. In any case we are ok, but I"
371,5.0,"Luxurious, beautiful, and fun!!",Rooms were renovated when we stayed and the atmosphere was just so fun and luxurious! loved it there so much! super clean and would love to stay there again. casino games were okay but shops and hotel was easy to move around and cool to explore!!
372,5.0,Vegas get away,"Excellent resort with all the amenities, perfectly situated in the strip . The music and Bellagio fountains always delight . The conservatory is always a must see for us on each trip . The changing themes and decor are always breathtaking. The restaurants we visited had delicious food choices, service and ambience. The crepe stirs was always very popular- service is very prompt too."
373,4.0,Bellagio Stay,"Always a nice hotel but the sophistication of the staff is falling and the bed was far past the date of replacement. I was much more comfortable at Mandalay Bay. Although I would say that the guests, with some exceptions are higher quality than at other hotels"
374,4.0,Nice place to stay,Only problem was that the lights didn't work in the bathroom. So we couldn't shower in the morning. They fixed the lights a few hours later but was a huge inconvenience for us. Staff was very friendly though.
375,5.0,Great Hotel,"I visited Las Vegas for my 25th birthday and I had a blast. The bellagio was very nice and I liked the ambiance. From front desk to housekeeping, the staff was very nice and welcoming. I enjoyed the many restaurant options available within the hotel along with the location."
376,5.0,great get away,this is the very BEST place to stay in Vegas. I love the atmosphere and the feeling you get there its Beautyful ! the People that work there are great and always helpful ! The food there is always excellent and the coffee the best ! I cant wait to go back !
377,4.0,Pretty good but overbilled twice,The casino and hotel are very nice but I got overbilled twice - once when I got in the previous occupant cleaned out the snacks so I called the front desk and they said they would take care of it. Of course there were still 2 charges I had to email to get corrected. Then I was charged a deposit for my in-laws room and they never credited her with it and have yet to remove the charge from my account - Still waiting for my credit from Bellagio....
378,5.0,A Little Extra,Went to celebrate my wife's birthday. The hotel is so nice and we were able to get a room with the fountain and strip view that was just so amazing. Love the variety of restaurants offered. And it is so well located that you can literally walk to any other place if you are looking for something different to eat or do. The rooms and the casino were so clean and constantly being cleaned. For the most part the safety was very high. Can't wait to go again.
379,5.0,Perfect experience at the Bellagio,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 5-day stay at the Bellagio. Our room was a Stay Well room where the air was purified regularly and the shower head was equipped with something that took away chlorine, leaving our skin smooth. We ate at Spago where the food was wonderful and the service exceptional We won at the slots, so that was an extra benefit. All staff throughout the casino were helpful and friendly."
380,5.0,Quick Get Away,A quick short trip to get away to enjoy some gambling at a great hotel. Great location and wonderful staff. Easy walking distance to several other nice hotels and casinos. Room service was great even though my breakfast order was wrong. They were very prompt to correct the problem. What else could you ask for.
381,4.0,Billagio Fun,Wonderful to look out of our room and see the dancing fountains. A fountain view is worth the extra. The only negative was they were using a large amount of the parking toe change out from the Christmas decorations.
382,5.0,business trip,great hotel. Gym is very good. one of the best on the strip. always very clean and nice place to stay. I would recommend staying to anyone that wants a high end hotel and facilities to enjoy some time in Las Vegas.
383,5.0,Amazing,The staff here is amazing! The hotel is beyond beautiful! Everything we needed was right within walking distance! It is centered right in the middle of everything! We will definitely stay here again!!
384,4.0,Very Nice Stay!,"Very clean hotel and casino. Security measures in place, so we always felt safe. It was one of the only hotels that had their pool open and it was heated. Good food choices and easy check-in/check-out."
385,5.0,Always a great stay,Ot was our third time staying at Bellagio in the last year. We have made it our annual birthday tradition. The location on the strip can't be beat and the views are fantastic. We love the rooms and awesome staff and the food options are always great. Can't wait for the next trip.
386,5.0,Great service.,Took a trip for my buddy’s birthday and the Bellagio was perfect. The rooms were clean. The room service we ordered was delicious and the tables and slots were hot. Perfect location on the strip. Would def come back again. Make sure to sign up for M-Life rewards.
387,5.0,5 star stay,The hotel staff were accommodating and very attentive to my needs. The bell desk promptly pulled my bags out of the taxi and had them delivered to our room once we checked in. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Getting extra pillows and towels was as easy as picking up the phone and calling housekeeping. Every contact with staff was amazing as well as the great in room dining! Will stay here again.
388,5.0,Best Trip Ever,"Had the best trip ever! Thank you so much. The experience, staff, cleanliness, ambiance was everything! My boyfriend and I had a beautiful stay. Can’t wait to come back. Definitely would suggest going to Lago. That is the best restaurant on the strip ❤️"
389,4.0,Nice rooms,Like I said the rooms and beds were nice and comfortable but don't touch the mini bar I was charged for a $20 fireball when I dont even drink alcohol and was charged for 3 cans of soda when I only took 1 and the cans of soda are $10 each
390,5.0,Bellagio is awesome,"Our stay at the Bellagio was excellent. The property is beautifully maintained. We had a corner suite and it was incredibly comfortable. It was a long hallway lol. The observatory looked beautiful, the casino is well laid out with a great vibe. Lots of great places to eat. Our daily breakfast and sometimes lunch at Sadelle’s was outstanding. The food was delicious and the staff were all super friendly. You definitely want to make it a stop while there. Check in was a breeze, the bell desk was quick and so was the valet. It is certainly a 5 star."
391,5.0,"FIRST TIME as a guest, but won’t be my last!","Accommodations, staff, restaurants, casino, shoppes - EXCELLENT!! Last minute decision to travel and weekend was perfect. Weather was better than expected, pool was opened, and was treated royally. The atmosphere was classy, fun and super friendly. Would recommend easily."
392,5.0,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"Three nights at the Bellagio and we loved it. From the penthouse suite we stayed in to the staff on the casino floor all were amazing, professional, courtesy and will to help. Thank you Bellagio!!!!!!"
393,5.0,Wonderful!,"The Bellagio is a one-of-a-kind experience. Great atmosphere, the rooms are spectacular, and you feel like royalty being there. Absolutely loved Lago, especially as we sat on the patio and got to watch the water show. Hard to beat this place!"
394,5.0,Vegas Trip,Convenient location for shopping and restaurants. The fountain is incredible and the outside area on propertywas extremely clean. Staff was great. Environment was great! Highly recommend for all who want a very nice getaway!
395,5.0,Beautiful hotel,This is an absolutely beautiful hotel. We went here for our 20th anniversary. And right when you walk in it’s absolutely beautiful the room was absolutely beautiful. The staff is very sweet and amazing. We are going to be going back to Vegas in October and we wanted to stay here but the room that we want it was sold out. This is definitely on the top of my list of places to stay when we visit Las Vegas.
396,4.0,Long weekend getaway,"Ruben at the front desk was wonderful and very helpful with any questions that we had during check in. The first morning I was a bit upset because housekeeping called my room at 9am to find out best time to clean room even though I had privacy sign on my door and we wanted to sleep in. Saturday evening we ate at Mayfair Supper Club and food/service/entertainment were all amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant. I set up late check out for Monday at 3pm, but it didn’t seem like systems were up to date. The manager knocked on our door close to noon to find out if we were checking out. Not long after, the housekeeper knocked on our door to ask what time we were checking out so she could clean the room. That whole time we had our privacy sign on our door. We chose late check out"
397,5.0,50th Birthday,"This is absolutley the best hotel to book on the strip, by far. The lobby area is beautiful, I have never seen anything like it!!! The fountain show is amazing and right at your feet. The casino has good ventilation, clean and great service. There are so many restaurants to choose from and shopping opportunities. We had an amazing time and will definetly book the next time we are visiting!!"
398,5.0,I can never stay anywhere else,"Bright, clean, vibrant facility with amazing restaurants. All staff were kind and professional. The fountain view room was a dream and the bed felt like a cloud. When I return to Vegas, it must be at the Bellagio. If you're going to do Vegas, DO VEGAS. It's worth it"
399,5.0,Bellagio is the best ever!,"Thank you Bellagio for the best experience ever! If you haven’t stayed at the Bellagio or visited the Bellagio you haven’t experienced what a 5 star hotel really is. From checking in to checking out, you couldn’t ask for better service…hands down the best!"
400,5.0,Five star from start to finish!,"Recently redecorated rooms with an emphasis on comfort and quality. Great dining experiences and gaming. We didn’t go to a show this time, but we enjoyed the conservatory’s fabulous artistic displays featuring the Chinese New Year. We also enjoyed shopping conveniently located within easy walking distance of the hotel."
401,3.0,"Ok, not great","Overall nice. Biggest issue was maid service. Came 1st night, never again. No notice and of course, no discount. Had to down size a room, no discount. Casino extremely smoky. Easy to access dining options limited"
402,1.0,Not the Grand experience you’d expect,"The best part is just the lobby and the fountain, don’t pay to stay here. Avoid the spa tower, it’s quite far from the front of the hotel. Rooms are quite dated, sofa cushions are flat and worn out, furniture is scratched, Bathroom fixtures are old, and tv was at least 15 years old. Sure the rooms being old, what can you do, but the customer service was also pretty bad! WiFi connectivity was not working. I called front desk, and an engineer came but said they couldn’t do anything. I had to call back and had to push the front desk staff to change us to another room rather than forwarding us off to mobility services. Inferior room was assigned in repercussion. Newly assigned room was dirty and had white crusty material on nightstand glass. But we had already switch rooms once"
403,5.0,Our stay at the Beautiful Bellagio.,"Beautiful Hotel,good customer service and clean.Easy location from where ever you want to go.Staffs helpful and courteous.Good restaurants and shops in. I’m definitely recommend it.The Fountain show is Amazing."
404,3.0,I received room keys for a room that was still occupied,"First time staying at Bellagio. Resort fees and taxes are fairly high. During check-in, I received room keys for a room that was still occupied. Bad mistake by someone or by their computer systems. I was not offered any type of comp for this mistake, and the consequences could have been horrendous if the person was physically in the room at the time I opened the door."
405,5.0,BEST EXPERIENCE!!,"This really is an exceptional hotel in Vegas. We wouldn't stay anywhere else. The rooms, service and breakfast are all top class. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Vegas. Also, the best customer service."
406,5.0,Best view in town,"Excellent rooms, would recommend booking in off season for afforability reasons ... room was beautiful, could have been a little quieter from other customers running down hall yelling but otherwise perfect room"
407,5.0,Best hotel in Vegas,"We go to Las Vegas 5, 6 times a year Bellagio is better than any other hotel 👍👍👍 Good service Very clean room Good restaurant / good food Exceptional staff We will come back here next time Definitely recommend"
408,5.0,Wonderful experience,"We had an updated room facing the fountains. So, we enjoyed watching the show right from our room any time we were in room. Especially, when got back from the dog show and ordered in-room dining. We ordered breakfast the next day as well. So convenient and delicious. Food at the Lago was delicious and service was great. Boutique stores were attentive and respectful. We had a great experience. It was our first time at the hotel."
409,5.0,Amazing stay,"This is the best hotel in Las Vegas. We have stayed at other properties and had fun. But the service and friendly staff here are amazing. For the best experience in Vegas this is the place. The shows, food, and rooms here are amazing"
410,4.0,Review,"Great place but very pricey room rates & resort fees on top. Would not have stayed there if I did not have a free room as my stay was short. Overall a good experience, greatly enjoyed the garden set up for Chinese New Year."
411,2.0,"No coffee makers, clothes iron, in expensive suites.","it's surprising to us that one of the most luxurious hotels in Vegas does not have the usual in room conveniences such as a coffee maker or hot water kettle, or microwave, that other less expensive hotels routine have. Bellagio is more focused on making you spend money at their hotel, than making your stay easy and relaxing. They seem to want to make leave your room and go to casino, restaurants, etc, than to lounge and relax in your rooms."
412,5.0,Exceptional Hotel with Opalescent Amenities,I would recommend and have recommended this hotel over and over. I visited nearly every hotel within 0.5miles during our stay and Bellagio was by far our favorite of them all. The staff was superb and the room was clean.
413,5.0,Exceptional Hotel with Opalescent Amenities,I would recommend and have recommended this hotel over and over. I visited nearly every hotel within 0.5miles during our stay and Bellagio was by far our favorite of them all. The staff was superb and the room was clean.
414,4.0,"Beautiful property, the hotel staff were amazing worth the money to stay, I wish there were jacuzzi styled tubes during","Great location, water show is amazing it is in the center of the strip. Sports book is stunning and huge in size. Has good poker and lots to do. If it’s your first trip out to the strip you will love the location."
415,4.0,Could be better,"1. Please offers few free bottle water in rooms. 2. Please spare some space in the refrigerator. 3. The Buffet: the worst buffet I ever had in Vegas, worst than Golden Corral. We paid $60 per person, the waitress didn't bring us a glass of water after we were seated after 30 minutes until I asked. The foods quality and selections were so bad, again, worst than Golden Corral. With the $$ we paid, we can go to a restaurant thousand times better than The Buffet at Ballagio. The fountain view room is awesome but I wish they can place the couch facing the window so we can sit comfortably to enjoy watching the fountain show."
416,3.0,Upscale but…..,"If you plan to stay here its a really nice hotel, don't get me wrong. Fountain view room was amazing since we didn’t have to go to the strip and watch the show. I booked 3 rooms for a group and the main complaint we can all agree on is the club across the street makes for a crappy nights sleep. There music is so loud from 12AM-6AM it shakes the room. Unfortunately due to this reason we will not be staying here in the future. If either they fix sound deadening or the club stops the 12AM schedule then we will gladly stay elsewhere."
417,5.0,Bellagio recent stay,Beautiful room. Excellent location. Restaurants were wonderful.The amenities and the room were perfect. Loved the beautiful Chinese New Year decorations in the solarium. This is the best hotel in Vegas!
418,5.0,Great Stay! Highly Recommend!,"I recently stayed at the Bellagio this past week, January 11th-13th, for business and I was pleasantly surprised at not only the wonderful character of the hotel itself, but also the cleanliness and friendly staff. When going on a vacation or a business trip customer service is a high priority and I felt the staff here really took the time to get to know you and actually care about their customer. There’s a great selection of restaurants and all types of food. I have tried most of the restaurants here and the food, ambiance, and entertainment was excellent! I highly recommend staying here when you visit Las Vegas. I know I will be back very soon. Thank you!"
419,4.0,Bellagio,Beautiful hotel but food options very poor. Only the little snack place open 24 hrs and it was always packed and food options odd. Room service fast but not many options. However it’s hard to complain about the bellagio always beautiful!
420,4.0,6/5 Blackjack is a bummer,"Sad to see 6/5 blackjack on the casino floor. 100 per hand to get a fair game is just too much. Our group was of mixed ages. The younger guys who are just starting in their careers want to have fun gambling, but with only high house edge games - it is not gambling; it is more like throwing money to the house. We loved the property, but we had to go to other places looking for a lower house hold game."
421,5.0,Getaway,"I thought the Bellagio was very pretty, very elegant. I really enjoyed the staff at the casino here, they were on time with drinks and they kept em coming too! Fun time staying here to look around or gambling you’ll enjoy the view"
422,1.0,$25 minimum Blackjack tables,"If you want to play Blackjack, this is not the casino. Even at 2am in the morning, you will not see a $25 table. There are slot blackjack machines at $5 but that’s not the same as a table. Also no complimentary coffee in the rooms."
423,3.0,my real rating is 3.5,"My previous trip to Las Vegas was three years ago and that time I stayed at Wynn. Because my previous trip was fairly recently, this unintentionally turned into a Bellagio vs.Wynn comparison. Small things: - Bellagio has keypads on the walls to regulate the curtains, Wynn has an actual remote control. - Wynn has a button by each door that you can press to alert the housekeeping staff that your room is ready to be cleaned. Bellagio doesn't have anything of the sort, and if you had a privacy sign on your door the first time housekeeping came around, it is unlikely they will check again. Of the six days I was there, two days the room wasn't cleaned. If you are a late riser like me, you have to call housekeeping and specifically request it. - I don't remember this part about"
424,1.0,Not even one star.,"No in room coffee. Available at 10.00 per cup though. No robe but will deliver a dingy, wrinkled robe upon request. Eighteen dollars a day and every time you leave. The front desk could never figure out how to bill it to our room. Was denied entry to the O show for 6 people because the buyer was not present. It was my mother in law who did not come on tbe trip. The Ballagio security was creepy, following people to their rooms. Never again. Very disappointed."
425,5.0,Excellence Epitomized,"Superior hotel with exquisite and classic aesthetic. For a higher end visit, Bellagio is the epitome. Will return again and again. Recommend for those seeking best in class hotel and casino. Elegant and casual dining for all tastes!"
426,5.0,Love this place!,"This was a great vacation stay…we will definitely be back! The staff were great, rooms were clean and for the ones that like nightcaps..the refrigerator was fully stocked. Of course…there casino and the different shoppes were amazing. Great job Bellagio and to the staff for getting it right!"
427,5.0,Beautiful views,Amazing stay at Bellagio would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to have a great time and great experience. The view was absolutely amazing. The customer service was also amazing. will come back again!
428,4.0,Holiday Beauty at the Bellagio,"The Bellagio during the holidays is absolutely beautiful! When we walked in on a Monday morning two days after Christmas we were in awe of the decorations and the beauty in the lobby. It was early in the morning, but the desk was kind enough to let us check in early and go to the room. First we had to wander around and look at the incredible complexity and beauty of the conservatory. It was filled with elaborate scenes made with real flowers. The Bellagio is an expensive stay, but a great experience. If it is your first time on the strip, start here."
429,5.0,Hassle free and luxurious,"I booked a weekend stay for my family and I. Everything about the Bellagio was effortless and luxurious. I was able to check in through the mobile app and I chose the option to use a mobile key so there was no need to go to the front desk to check in which I appreciate during this ongoing pandemic. The room was amazing and clean. Though we didn’t get the strip view, the view of the mountains was also beautiful. Would definitely stay here again!"
430,5.0,Best spot on the strip!,"Absolutely love the Bellagio! The staff is so kind and professional! The food is amazing! The rooms are top notch! The gaming is so fun! But the biggest difference between bellagio and other places is the atmosphere! High end, high class, fun, safe!"
431,4.0,Bellagio delivers,"First time staying At Bellagio. Not crazy smoky, staff were very friendly. Buffet is a little over priced. Room definitely had some minor issues. Not enough to need immediate fixing. The service and food at Sadelle was perfect."

433,2.0,Blah-agio,"First off the positives..Staff very helpful and not crabby. Poker room was big, nice, not long wait to get onto a table. Thats it for the positives. Arrived went to room, walked in, saw a towel on the bathroom floor, didnt think too much about it, a few more steps in, saw the bed was not made and looked as if someone just got out of it. Called front desk moved me quickly. Next room, clean, TV would not stay on, who cares off to gamble. Come back to room. About 5ish or 6ish in the morning, hallway argument, room next door tons of cussing and yelling, huge bang against the wall. I'm out. Go to front desk, tell them about that, move me again. 3rd room, super clean (all rooms were on the same floor),TV still would not stay on, maintenance came and reset the"
434,1.0,Don’t stay!,The only thing that was great was the check in everything else from housekeeping to players club to host was a S show! I expected the same quality and friendliness that I get when staying at Encore suites. It wasn’t even close. They need to step it up if they want to keep their players and guests!
435,4.0,Hotel review,"Very nice stay hotel was beautiful but our room smelled badly of marijuana. Staff was very friendly and timely. Rosely at the check in counter was wonderful. Views were excellent. Lots of unwanted black hair in our room wasn't cleaned very good, pills, wrappers on the ground etc"
436,5.0,Nice stay,We stayed 6 nights in a premiere king room. The room was clean and quiet. We were only up early 2 days so the room was only serviced twice. First time was odd. Towels were thrown over the bathroom door. A dirty washcloth was left as clean. My personal clothing and toiletries were moved. My husband had a nosebleed and there was a small drop of dried blood on the sheets. It looked like they sprayed the sheet to remove the blood then made the bed with the dirty sheet. It has a pink smear where the blood was. Very odd. The second cleaning was great. Clean folded towels and sheets. Not sure what happened the first time. Wi-Fi worked well. The bed was comfortable. We enjoyed our stay.
437,3.0,Too $$$$ and not clean enough,"We bought into un upgrade $50 per night for a better view of the penthouse suite. You could only see 1/2 the Bellagio fountain but in addition a parking lot , wouldn’t call this an upgrade. Also it seemed that our suite was directly above a night club, loud music and base until 2am. We are seniors as an employee you should not put up in a room like this. Also the first thing noticeable in the room were “streak” marks (sex) on some furniture pieces, couch & chair, disgusting. Maybe the Bellagio should invest in furniture you can actually wipe off or have a deep cleaning crew come in for that, disgusting."
438,3.0,Clean rooms but not good for business travelers,Very thin walls - lots of noise. Terrible wifi in the newly remodeled rooms. Therefore the TV will not work as well. No response from Management on feedback. Terrible fitness center hours if you are a business traveler. I understand there are limits due to the pandemic but this should be adjusted. I did not leave a public review after my last stay hoping to hear back from management after other issues with my past stay but no response. I decided to share start publicly sharing feedback with the hope that they start addressing issues.
439,5.0,Always a great stay.,Not many places one the strip that offers the kind of room stay that allows you to not even have to leave your room and still enjoy your stay in Vegas. My wife and I have stay at the Bellagio on several occasions and have enjoyed the amenities in the hotel that we didn’t even have to hit the strip until late evening maybe for a show or two. I travel the world and the Bellagio is my choice of hotel.
440,2.0,Bellagio not what is once was,"Bellagio quality has significantly declined in recent years. Rooms were not cleaned, broken items in room. Hookers doing business on casino floor in front of staff, I know it's Vegas but we have never seen so much low class trash walking around the Bellagio, it is much worse than 2 years ago."
441,1.0,Bellagio,Supposed to be a luxurious place to stay but we were kept up til 4 in the morning due to a club that played music til then and we could hear in our room. It was very bad. Didn't ask for anything or to be moved because we just wanted to sleep but couldn't sleep with the noise.
442,5.0,Bellagio - make your special event even more special,Absolutely beautiful hotel. From the minute you walk in with the glass flowers and silver horse you know you are staying somewhere special. Enjoy the atrium with the Chinese New Year theme. We ate at three of the restaurants on site and highly recommend the Lago - delicious!!!
443,4.0,Great stay just wish shower had a door,"Staying here hit all my expectation, but unfortunately the shower did not have a door so when half your body is in the warm water the other half is freezing and once you turn off the water your a popsicle. During our stay it was cold outside so all we wanted was to come back to our room to warm up and it was frustrating to take a “warm” shower to “warm up” just to be cold again if not colder. If there was an option for a heater in the bathroom I would get not having a door but there is not. If they get doors on there showers they would be worth the price."
444,2.0,"Over pricesr, $22.00 for a small bottle of water in the room. The slot machines were very tight.","There seemed to be deceptive practices to really milk guests of money at every opportunity. For example, there were several bottles of water in the room for purchase. However, there were no visible price listing. We arrived after midnight and the tap water smelt like sulfur. We decided to open a bottle of water…$22.00!!! Yes, $22.00 for a small bottle of water. The slot machines were very tight. We didn't see many people winning. We never won. It was quite bring to play. I saw one man who won a jackpot of $1300. He told me he would need to hit that 10 more times to get his money back. The view, location snd customer services were great. Our room seemed dated, the faucets were loose and falling apart. We wont return."
445,1.0,Do NOT book Tower Fountain View- Club bass all night!,"My husband and I have stayed at the Bellagio many times and always have had a wonderful time, always booking a fountain view because I love watching the fountains from our room. I took my daughter, 13 years old, to Vegas for a gymnastics competition and wanted to treat her to the amazing Bellagio experience, eating dinner at a nice restaurant topped off with seeing “O”, so I spent extra and booked the Tower Fountain view room. Big mistake!!! We had no idea that the Marquee club would be adjacent to our room with club music thumping until 2:15. After coming back to our room from the late “O” show around 11:30 pm, we enjoyed the fountains and then went to bed. The noise from the club was unbearable so I called the front desk and they agreed to change our room to the standard"
446,5.0,business meeting/ marriage getaway,great customer service and convention (medical meeting) accommodations. the food at Prime was excellent (but pricey). Loved the view of the fountains from the room with the choreographed music playing on the TV
447,3.0,Nothing EXCEPTIONAL at the BELLAGIO!,"Bellagio has become an average Las Vegas Hotel. The staff was ok, rooms were ok, the only staff that were outstanding, were the valet attendants and the entire staff at the Mayfair Supper Club! Little offended that as a hotel guest, they wanted to charge to see the Art Exhibit!"
448,5.0,very expencive but excellent,"the best location in Las Vegas strip with a wonder full interieur. offers a lot of possibilities . shame that there was only 1 pool available . the others no water, Very high price level To see the show of Cirque de soleil"
449,3.0,Not what I expected for a luxury hotel,"Customer service wasn’t great. Parking attendant were blah(18 to park+ resort fee), this should be included. They didn’t say hi or smile. If you were not their “member “, they are pretty rude, maybe it was the person that approached us for standing in the wrong line, even though one of their employees told us to go there due to hotel key issue. My husband and I was not impressed for a luxury hotel. The shower head was terrible, again nothing to complain about right then and there. We didn’t expect a lot due to staff shortage, but honestly a hello and a smile goes a long way. Pretty pricey hotel for mediocre service and rooms."
450,5.0,The best of the best,"Great service, clean rooms and lots of security on the property made us feel comfortable and safe. The restaurants and snack shops all had wonderfully tasty food. The gambling was also priced just right, a little for the high rollers and a little for the weekend gambler. Something for everyone."
451,4.0,Beautiful,"Mother/daughter birthday celebration. Took in Cirque ""O"" and was less than impressed. Had wanted to see for years and it turned out to be half talent, class and awe and half vaudeville unrelated chaos. We ate at Spago which had excellent service, superb food, patio dining and the view was extraordinary."
452,5.0,An unforgettable birthday,"I wish I had more time to enjoy everything the Bellagio had to offer, but in a very short, we enjoyed the most exceptional, fountain-side room, a meal at Prime, a tour of the conservatory, and the soundtrack that was playing everywhere. Once in a lifetime!"
453,5.0,Perfect,"The staff of the bellagio ware welcoming and very friendly , the experience at the Bellagio was very nice , the casino is very nice and big where people are winning . The spa is very nice and also the restaurant especcialy Spago"
454,5.0,Wonderful stay at the beautiful Bellagio,The Bellagio upgraded our room and flowers from the concierge for daughter's 21st birthday! The concierge was very knowledgeable about the shows and got us some incredible seats. Room was wonderful and had some great extras in the room!
455,2.0,Don't stay here if you're young,"Rooms are great, but the staff discriminates against younger patrons. If you are in your twenties, the staff is unlikely to take you seriously. Even when I was trying to get to the elevators, the security stopped me as aggressively demanded for me to show them my room key to prove that I was staying at the hotel. I was the only young person around going upstairs and I was the only person to get stopped. Security wasn't even polite about asking for my key. Very rude and discriminatory people."
456,4.0,Great New Years Eve weekend!,"We came to Las Vegas for the New Years holiday (as well as to see Usher at Ceasar's for his last show of his residency). This was my husband's first time coming to Las Vegas so I definitely wanted todo it right for him, plus I'd always wanted to stay at the Bellagio. So we booked here a few months prior. Our room was in the spa tower, which initially I thought would be a pain getting there but it really wasn't so we didn't mind at all. Our room was clean and we had a strip view so we could watch the fountains go off from our room. Beds comfy, bathroom decent size. We really couldn't have asked for more. Only reason it's not getting 5 stars from me is service was a bit slow; however, given it was New Years weekend and Las Vegas in general was packed this likely was a large"
457,5.0,1/7/22-1/13/22,"You are paying for location and or view. Room wasn’t as big as shown on website, but nice. If you know king sized beds you will recognize these aren’t king sized beds. Our experience with housekeeping was exceptional. Buffet is overrated for the price which was sad to say because I had heard so much about it. Covid related? Location is pretty great if you are looking for a stroll on the strip. But get a pass on the Deuce and you could stay anywhere for less money. The property is a lot larger than you think so take the time to walk around all the nooks and cranny’s. Half the pools were closed for seasonal repair no biggie and understandable. If you are on the fountain side on a weekend be prepared for Beer Park or Cabo Wabo to have the bass thumping until 2:30. Overall this"
458,5.0,Easy check-in,Able to check-in on line and do not have to wait on line to get room key. Very nice room and view to see Las Vegas strip. Easy check out via cell phone and just drop room key in dedicated box. Many good food and restaurant and affordable.
459,2.0,Spoiled 50th Birthday,First time in Vegas. We decided to stay at a 5-star hotel since we were celebrating my husband's 50th birthday. Spent more time complaining to the hotel staff when we should have been out enjoying the strip. Would never stay here again.
460,5.0,Best Hotel in Vegas,"Great experience! Hotel was very clean, didn’t smell like cigarettes. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was nice, and bed was comfy. Overall a great experience. I dont want to stay at any other hotel while in Vegas, moving forward"
461,5.0,Bellagio for New Years 2022,We had a great time over New Year's which was made possible by the arrangements made by our host Michael Black and the attention he paid to our needs. Our only concern was the seemingly lackadaisical enforcement of the internal masking requirement.
462,5.0,Bellagio,"Great time over the holidays, friendly staff, just perfect. Clean, housekeeping was great, bell hop was great, great view from our room. Room service was quick and friendly. Check in was busy but went fast overall great time and will be coming back to stay"
463,5.0,Our Christmas in Vegas,We had a fantastic time at Christmas! Staff was attentive and courteous. Food was great! Overall a great time. Can’t wait to come back in March. There are plenty of gaming options as well. The best part was our room with a view of the fountains!
464,5.0,Luxury Hotel/Excellent Restaurants,"Room was comfortable & clean. I ate at 2 restaurants (Jasmine & Yellowtail). Excellent food & service. Everything is pricey of course. Gambling is not too good as there is shortage of dealers due to Covid. Overall, good trip."
465,5.0,Absolutely amazing,Everyone on staff are always so helpful and welcoming. I was helped on many occasions by many levels of staff and all treated me very well. Cleanliness is 11 out of 10. It’s Bellagio and it’s the absolute pinnacle of Vegas !! Thanks you for treating me and my girl so well can’t wait to stay again
466,5.0,Top 4 hotel on the strip,The Bellagio hotel is definitely one of the top 4 best. It is extremely nice and very beautiful. Right outside the Bellagio you can find the lovely Bellagio fountains which give off what is called “the Bellagio water show”. Thanks for a great stay!
467,5.0,Beautiful Place,"We enjoyed staying there. The room, the atmosphere, are very very nice. The water fountain shows are fabulous. The house keeping workers did a good job cleaning the rooms.Hope to stay there again on our next vacation. Aloha!"
468,5.0,Great stay at Bellagio!,Fantastic dinner at the Mayfair Supper Club. The show was excellent and the food was very good. Gaming was good as always. Room was perfect. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Thanks for a great stay.
469,4.0,Wonderful place to stay,We stayed in fountain view room with 2 queen size beds. The room was lovely and the restroom was big however the heater didn’t work well - we cranked it up to 80 degrees however the room didn’t get warm enough. I think the comfortable bed and down comforter made up for it. We didn’t get hand towels and wash rages our first night so we asked housekeeping and they were provided. Other than that I would definitely come back to stay at this hotel.
470,4.0,Nice Hotel,"I enjoyed our stay at the Bellagio. The room was very clean and the floor we stayed out was nice and quiet. The fountain view we had was ok. If we return to the Bellagio the next time we're in Las Vegas, I probably wouldn't spend the extra money for that particular view. Overall, I enjoyed the trip and felt very safe at the hotel."
471,3.0,Not really happy,"Be careful do not touch anything, it was weight sensor, you move you pay for it. Just pay attention when you check out, we don’t get any notes about that. Also, check your bed when you come, mine have hairs on the bed, have to call them to change the sheets."
472,5.0,Excellent Bellagio!,"During check-in there was a little lengthy queue and minor issue to find the type of room we wanted - ready on time. But then after everything went like smooth and heavenly. The room was great, property was one of the best, if not the very best - in Vegas. We ended up extending our stay by a couple of more days. We enjoyed the spa and massage center as well. The restaurants inside Bellagio can get booked fast. So watch that. Overall excellent!"
473,5.0,Vegas vacation,"Bellagio is a very clean, beautiful place with a sincere staff that will make your stay a pleasant one. We experienced exceptional service during our stay. We had breakfast at Sadelle's Cafe twice during our stay. I recommend giving them a try."
474,4.0,Redneck in a fancy hotel,I honestly liked the Excalibur better. There’s a $300 deposit that isn’t mentioned when booking. The bed was firm and the pillows were annoying. Housekeeping CONTINUOUSLY bugged me while trying to sleep after a long night. The AC was at 60 but didn’t feel cold and couldn’t make it colder.
475,2.0,What an awful let down compared with my last stay here!,"If you are gold platinum or aspiring, there is absolutely no reason to stay here any more. Nearly all benefits have been removed. I went to the office to ask what happened to platinum check in and lounge use and the man was quite abrupt and said it was no longer available. I had extended my stay in Vegas and some free nights popped up in my email and front desk said maybe the casino would allow me to use them. At the office he told me about a rule that requires a three day gap before free nights can be used. He was quite strict and even looked up my play history and berated it saying I haven't gambled enough in a snooty manner. I mean seriously he works there but was behaving like some kind of high roller snob. He kept mentioning platinum noir (the invitation only level) as if"
476,5.0,A Classic Vegas Vacation,"Everything about our stay was top-notch. Our room was spacious, the bed very comfortable, the restaurants excellent. In short, it was a great stay. I highly recommend Bellagio if you're headed to Vegas."
477,1.0,"Rooms not clean, smelled of cigar smoke, shower head broken, shower door let’s water all over floor, tub faucet leaks","Room had a half drank bottle of Gatorade in fridge, hair on bed, shower head broken, tub faucet leaked all over floor, got a replacement room and it stank like cigar smoke, got another replacement room and shower head broken in that room too and shower door doesn’t seal properly and bath rug was saturated with water"
478,5.0,Best experience money can buy,You can’t beat the feel good ambiance you get from staying in any hotel in vegas or anywhere.excellence is daily practice here. You won’t be disappointed.the only negative this casino have is the same as all casino’s in vegas is doing away with 10 dollars crap tables that frustrates all crap game lovers.hope the re think that strategy again.
479,2.0,Aged & Unloved Room,My room in spa tower looked like it was built in 2000 and untouched since. Green calcium buildup on all faucets/shower. Old and worn out electrical fixtures. Furniture was very beaten up/marked. Not at all the bellagio experience I expected.
480,5.0,Favorite place to stay in Vegas,We have such a wonderful experience each and every time we stay at Bellagio - cannot imagine staying anywhere else. Beautiful hotel and casino. Staff are just amazing - everyone is so friendly and helpful.
481,2.0,"Free Stay, $600 in untold holds","I had 2 ""complementary nights "" at the Bellagio. There was $102 in resort fees and taxes which I understood. During my stay, that amount went almost $600 in holds without any prior notice or info about that on my reservation or receipt! If I didn't put money on my card on a whim I would've been overdrawn by hundreds"
482,5.0,The place to stay,The hotel was great. The room was great and fully stocked. Everything was very cleanly. The staff was beyond amazing and helped us with everything we needed. I’ve stayed at a number of hotels on the strip and the Bellagio was definitely my favorite.
483,5.0,Bellagio does it again!,We loved our stay at the Bellagio! The hotel Management & staff were superior and provided us with excellent service! The restaurants and lounges were amazing & the food and drinks were delicious & tasty!
484,2.0,"Poor room service,",I was expecting excellent daily cleaning service at Bellagio. I only received 1 cleaning of my room of the 4 nights I stayed. I feel taken advantage of at these prices when I arrive back at my hotel room from a long day and find no service provided. I then have to either use damp towels or call for new ones. I should not have to daily call housekeeping to be provided with essentials.
485,5.0,Table games - Baccarat,"Would like to say thank you to floor manager in Baccarat room Mark Sirota He is very nice, helpful It was a pleasure to meet you there Hope to see you again soon this year Coming back for sure this coming summer Thank you"

488,5.0,Ali Fahami,"I had an exceptional quality service from the time I registered until I checked out. The rooms are the cleanest on any of the Vegas's properties. I have been traveling to Vegas for over 40 years, Bellaggio is by far the most beautiful Hotel and the Casino staff are the friendliest of all the Hotels i have ever stayed at."
489,1.0,Got Robbed from my Room,I got robbed for a large some of money out of my room ( Over 10 thousands of dollars). And after days have gotten no help from the hotel. They had problems with this individual in the past and seems to be on a list to not let them on the grounds. While a maid saw this person walk in and out of my room without telling anyone. Some how this individual made it through security and go to a floor that you had to have a exact key to get on this floor. During the trip a manager confirmed there was problems with my door. But nothing has been done
490,5.0,Flowers and Fountains!,"Honestly most iconic place in Vegas. You are going to stop by anyway, why not just stay there.the year of the tiger theme was amazing. Heated pools in winter was a special touch. Meticulously clean and service always top notch."

493,5.0,"Great Service from MGM booking rep, Bill for Christmas week, 2022","We’ve stayed at this great hotel a number of times and we just booked it for Christmas week, 2022 What made it great was the service of the MGM’s representative, Bill who set us up and cared for our happiness and appreciated our loyalty. Can’t wait for the great experience Bellagio always delivers!"
494,2.0,Total waste of your money,"The level of hospitality and the service provided don’t match the price of the room. Very poor service. Attention to the guest: none. I have reserved directly over the phone, not even using a 3rd party website with discounted rates… I booked a fountain view room for a special occasion (it was my fiancé’s and mine anniversary), which the hotel knew about. There wasn’t even a bottle of water available for us. Forget about bathrobes or slippers. Also the bed was made poorly, like upside down, with the open part of the duvet cover near the face, so the duvet slipped out of its cover during our sleep. The room is nice but there are none of the amenities that makes you feel cuddled and spoiled and that you usually find in hotels of the same price category. Also be mindful that the"
495,5.0,Best Hotel in Vegas,Bellagio provides the best customer service and experience of all LV hotels that I have stayed in. The casino is awesome. The food is superb. Plenty of folks available to make your stay in Las Vegas the best ever.
496,3.0,MY Stay at Bellagio,Great hotel with lots of great restaurants and bars. I had problem during checkout as the staff was not friendly and experienced. The hotel charges us a different rate than what was quoted. I suggest you become a member of their MLife club as they are more friendly.
497,5.0,Great !,"The room was amazing ! Since we arrived, the valet were so nice and very welcoming. Check-in was simply and easy and they made sure to answer any questions we had! Restaurants were amazing and the room was 👌"

I will be back!"
499,4.0,Good service,"Majority of staff were really nice, restaurant staff and spa staff were extremely friendly. Dealers are hit and miss, some nice ones and some really rude. Host had zero tact and was extremely rude. Overall wasn’t a terrible experience but could have been a lot better."

502,5.0,nice hotel,"the hotel was beautiful. and dead center of the strip MGM has done the greatest thing ever, they allow you to check in and check out via their app. This eliminates any waiting in lines to check in, I was able to check in as soon as the flight landed and by the time I arrived at the hotel the app alerted me the room was ready, 4 hours early. The room was big and had a beautiful view. I will definitely stay here again"

504,5.0,Best New Year's celebration 2021/22,"From the moment I stepped inside the Bellagio casino, I was treated as VIP at the hotel lobby and at the Mlife reward. Maybe that gave me a great luck. I noticed many guests hitting jackpots. I hit two jackpots myself. I played many games for my entire 4 nights stays and I didn't want to leave. I will be back for sure."
505,5.0,Great time at the Bellagio,I brought my wife to the Bellagio in Las Vegas for a Christmas present. It was a great time and all the staff were very attentive and friendly through the entire say. I would recommend your hotel to anyone. The location was great… Right in the middle of the strip

508,4.0,It use to be the best Hotel in vegas,I remember the first time when I stayed in this Hotel everything was perfect The service excellent Clean The rooms has all the amenities It was sad coming back after some years How everything change They even told me that if I want my room to be clean I have to call every morning to ask if they can come anc clean the room for me One day they forgot to do it and I have to call them twice the same day no towels they forgot to change the glasses one of them have lolipstick I cannot believe it was really disappointing
509,2.0,Gets disappointing day by day,"It would say not only the hotel has lost its glory but other hotels have progressed and improved a lot surpassing Bellagio by miles and miles. 1. Complete rip off - The bell desk charges $20 just to move few bags and water bottles to room. The prices are insane - for example Bellagio buffet on Friday costing $65 was a biggest joke! In no way it justifies the cost with respect to service, quality of food or varieties. 2. The rooms are not cleaned properly during stay as well as on check-in. One example was unflushed toilet on check-in. During stay also the room and the furniture was not cleaned properly. Last time I stayed at other MGM properties like Aria and Vdara. They were probably 100 times better in terms of service, quality, and comfort. I just gave one more shot to"
510,1.0,My first and last time,From the moment I checked in the level of rudeness and irritable displayed by the front Dess was unacceptable my room safe didn’t work the guys that work the elevator were totally rude as well Room service didn’t even bother to come in and change my covers or towels during my whole stay unless I called down to the front desk to get someone to come up
511,2.0,Not recommend,They only pay 6 to 5 instead of 3 to 2 for blackjacks. The video poker machines only pay 7 and 5 times for a full house and a flush respectively instead of normal 9 and 6. They charge for parking and charge resort fee and taxes for the comp room. The rooms are just average.
512,5.0,Great place,I have enjoyed staying at the Bellagio. It's location is the best. the restaurants and service were great. It was really joyful staying at the Bellagio and it was worth all the money spent there in comparison with other hotels next to it.

But early in our evening we were served by a not so nice bartender. It was like we were annoying her as we paid for three drinks. Then later in the evening we pretty much sat in the indoor bar seats for approx 5 hours gambling and partaking in a few beverages. We listened to our bartender, who poor guy, has to work extra hours cause his relief didn’t show. He did an outstanding job! His relief came in and he did an outstanding job! Then! When the relief guy went on break we asked for one last drink and I was denied? I had gambled for several hours on a machine but this gentleman said no your not"
528,5.0,"Amazing views, location, food and poker!!!",We spent 6 days for our 19th anniversary with our two 11 year old boys in Bellagio Penthouse facing the fountains. Views were just beautiful and it was great to watch fountains from our room at night. We saw 4 shows and it was super convenient to visit different casinos from Bellagio. Love poker and Bellagio has one of the best poker rooms. Finally food was phenomenal in Vegas in Bellagio but also other hotels.
529,5.0,Merry Christmas to me,Best ever trip to Vegas and stayied at the famous Bellagio Hotel Winning a a huge jackpot on a slot machine made this a trip to remember The food the service and the best views on the strip. Vegas is booming again Love my Vegas trips
530,5.0,Enjoyable vacation,"Nice room- initially reserved a one king standard room and was able to change to a two queen bed standard room without problem. I loved the convenience that other hotels/shops/restaurants are all within walking distance or a short tram ride over. I would love to stay there again, especially to see the garden display as they change it seasonally."
531,5.0,Excellent Stay,One of the best hotels in Las Vegas! Our family really enjoyed staying here. The room is modern and very clean. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Vegas. Their staff are really attentive and care for their guests.
532,5.0,Pretty awesome,"Went to Vegas for Christmas, awesome. Bellagio is very centrally located, didn't have to walk far to get anywhere. My wife and I had a king with street view, view was minimal but could also see the fountain so that was nice. Room was as described, one set of lights in the room didn't work but we didn't spend enough time in the room to care. Though I'm sure amenities were available we weren't interested in whatever they were. Would definitely stay here again."
533,5.0,Sons 21st birthday celebration.,"We had a wonderful time at the bellagio. The property is beautiful and luxurious. We went to see "" O "" and where astounded with the theater size, we also had a meal at Prime and enjoyed it immensely. We had fun gambling also as it was our sons first time doing it."
534,5.0,Most Elegant Resort In Vegas,Bellagio is by far the most elegant place to stay in Las Vegas. We are very loyal to Bellagio. My husband and I actually got married there. They hosted the most beautiful wedding we could have ever imagined.
535,5.0,Still the most beautiful place to stay,"My favorite hotel, so beautiful. Tons of new and exciting slot machines. And my choice to play poker hands down. The only issue is the covering of your face issue. Hopefully soon that will be a choice again."
536,5.0,Fantastic time!,"We had a family trip and we loved staying at the Bellagio! We ate many meals in the Bellagio restaurants and they were all delicious. The service at the hotel was prompt and thorough, and the staff were very kind. We went to the O aquatic show and it was spectacular! The casinos in the hotel were a lot of fun as well. Our family had a great trip and we're excited to come back to the Bellagio in the future."
537,3.0,Check-in staff was not friendly,The gentleman checking us in at the counter was not friendly. He asked me if I was in a hurry when I told him we were running up against a dinner reservation he said I would have to be patient and wait. I also felt that the items within the room we’re not explained well on what I would and would not be up charged for I called the hotel operator and when I spoke with her she laughed because she said her last call was for the exact same thing it seems like there’s a pattern in this area The room was nice and clean with modern amenities the bathroom was exquisite Based on the mini bar and the initial customer service alone however and comparing this to our experience earlier in the week at the Trump Hotel I will most likely not be staying with any MGM properties again as the
538,5.0,Contemporary Luxury with a Classic Mediterranean Twist,"Grandeur, opulence and luxury all describe the Bellagio experience, with the staff, attention to details and Mediterranean decor capping what is arguably the Strip's finest hotel. Location is also the center of the Vegas universe, only partially due to the fabulous fountains. Can't say enough good things about staying here, or the absolutely phenomenal dining at Jasmine, except that it's a bit pricey. But here you definitely get what you pay for."
539,2.0,Worst check-in ever,Check-in process was the worst I have ever experienced. Systems in place to help the process don't work or have flaws that essentially render them un-usable. Took us 6 hours to finally get checked into our room and staff did not seem to care.
540,5.0,Beloved Bellagio,"We stopped for one night on the way home to LA. We had two rooms and they were both clean, beautiful, and the beds were comfy. Everything about Bellagio is high quality from the linens to the service. Tip: when you pay to park you can access any MGM parking with your room key at no extra cost."
541,1.0,Encountered discrimination and personal attack by other guest.,"Encountered discrimination and personal attack by other guest and casino members mishandled the situation. I am waiting on a follow up call from Mike the casino manager for a follow up call or email. He agreed with me. He profusely apologized and agreed that his staff should have stepped up and they just didn't. This situation shouldn't have never happened and only one worker at the front desk and Mike understood the severity of it and agreed with me. Everyone else from front desk manager, Mr. Henry, another worker at the front desk and obviously the casino workers mishandled the whole situation. That is just too sad!"
542,3.0,"Good location, great room with comfortable bed.","Good overall. The room is spacious. The bed is clean and comfortable. However, there is too much smoke in the casino, and it is unavoidable when I go to garage, go out or go shopping. No escape. Also the charge for snack or drink in the room is outrageous, one bottle of Fuji water costs $22! Beside, there are too many people not wearing masks everywhere."
543,5.0,The Best Hotel on the Strip,"If you want a beautiful, clean, comfortable environment with excellent restaurant options stay at Bellagio. With a center strip location you couldn't asked for a more convenient option. The staff is friendly, helpful and professional. We loved our stay. Thank you Bellagio!"
544,4.0,Great Hotel in center of Las Vegas stripe.,"Our first trip after Covid-19 lockdown in 2.5 years, it's started off great we selected the VIP arrival experience package. The first couple of days were great, this package included the VIP Lounge which had small treats and drinks and no cost. But one of the days we walk in a service man providing the drinks question my life partner making him feel like we were stealing, and we did not belong in the VIP Lounge, so I notice what was going on and showed him we are paying for that service to de-escalate the situation after that we did not visit the VIP Lounge till, we checked out which was shameful that happen! I should have addressed that problem to management but was angry and did not want to deal this on our first vacation in 2.5 years."
545,3.0,A trip to see the show,"I took my daughter to see O and stayed at the Bellagio. The show was slow at times and really good at others, the hotel was pretty and clean. The staff was great! The reason for the review was the mattress is clearly old and lumpy, and the room wouldn’t cool off it was pretty hot no matter what temperature I set."
546,3.0,"Great Location, hotel quality wasn't the best.",Amazing Location. We loved how close everything was. We were able to comfortably walk to everything we wanted to. The hotel lobby was dirty and smelled terrible. The rooms were ok but the sheets felt like plastic and the housekeepers tried to come into our room in the mornings around 8-9 am without knocking which felt unprofessional.
547,5.0,Perfect !,I got a room for me and my significant other for New Year’s Eve! And the stay was perfect! The room was quit with a beautiful view even on the 6th floor! The room was cleaned to perfection! And the color scheme of the room was soothing!
548,5.0,Christmas at Belagio,"We loved staying here in December, the decorations are awesome and we were just in the middle at the Strip! Most impressed with the pool, it was heated and open - nice treat during the Holidays! Thank you!"
549,3.0,Disappointed,"The Bellagio is resting on its laurels from days gone by. The room had a number of maintenance issues. One of these I brought to the attention of housekeeping and they did remedy it slightly (shower door wouldn't close and water all over the bathroom floor) but it continued to be a problem. Thermostat didn't work properly, I was boiling on a cold December day, lamps broken, wallpaper peeling in bathroom, makeup mirror light didn't work. One thing after another. I did report most of these at check out and the agent gave us a credit for our very expensive breakfast which was unexpected but I still feel like they need to get their act together big time."
550,5.0,NYE experience,Purchased a Bruno Mars VIP package and stayed at the Bellagio. We had a fountain view King room - very spacious. A nice view of the Strip - the Eiffel Tower was right outside the window. We had an awesome experience!
551,4.0,VIEW OF THE FOUNTAIN,"A room with a view the Famous Fountain and the strip well worth every extra dollar. Will stay again. Plenty of restaurants a beautiful spa, great massage and manicure. The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is because I requested a wake up call and never received it. Luckily my phone was working, if not I would have missed my 5am flight. We were able to view the New Year eve fireworks right from our suite. Mask are required and they plenty to give out and hand sanitizer stations. The suite rooms are large with 2/12 bathrooms. You feel like you are at home. This was a dream vacation."
552,5.0,Beautiful stay,"Absolutely beautiful hotel , I would stay again for sure. Great restaurants , great heated pool, beautiful spa . Loved the fountains , wish they started earlier in the day . but absolutely suggest staying here."
553,5.0,Fountain view rooms are worth the ££,"Staying here has always been a dream, and more so to have a fountain view room. It didn’t disappoint! The room itself was very comfortable, clean and had everything we needed for a long weekend. We spent many hours watching the fountains from our window and watching the world pass. I would highly recommend if you can afford to do the fountain view, then do! You will not be disappointed. The hotel is in a fabulous location to get to either end of the strip and has enough going on not to even feel the need to leave. We timed our visit to coincide with the Christmas display and that too was worth a visit. All staff members that we encountered were super helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Richelle on the check in desk was fabulous and helped us above and beyond when"
554,5.0,Definitely dine in at Picasso!,"I gave Bellagio 5 stars because of the French restaurant, Picasso. The dining experience was exceptional and literally saved our lodging experience. Other than that, I would say avoid the end of the year. The rooms were over-priced due to the holiday. Some services weren't great. For example, the check-in staff told us that the pool wasn't open but it's actually open. Also, I have late check-out until 4 pm but someone was entering our room at 11 am. The check-out staff did waive the resort fee for us. Otherwise, the service wasn't that great."
555,5.0,Bellagio First Time Las Vegas,"Absolutely amazing! Excellent service, the Casino, Hotel, eateries, shopping, Uber, all ergonomic and easy to navigate. The scenery was phenomenal! We have visited multiple properties in Las Vegas and The Bellagio has set the tone for our future expectations!"
556,3.0,Just Okay,"I had very high expectations based on the price of my room during the New Years weekend. The location is great with high end shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Unfortunately the hotel fell short. Although the room was decorated nicely, I was located in a spot where I could hear the elevator. It sounded like an amusement park ride. Very annoying. There was also a musty smell between the bed and the side wall. I didn't ask to change rooms because I had waited in line to check in and although the service was friendly, the attendant acted as if he was clueless. I was just over it. I will not stay at the Bellagio again."
557,1.0,Bellagio ( PENTHOUSE) NO FOUNTAIN VIEW,"Snubbed of the room I originally purchased, only to be also given stained covers on the 2 day, peeling paint strips under the bar, and non functional drawers! Worst experience I’ve ever had at the Bellagio I was so disappointed!"
558,3.0,Mediocre at best,"My experience was mediocre at best. This was the first time staying at the Bellagio and I was not ""blown away"" with my experience. The staff was not overly enthusiastic and the cocktail waitresses were nowhere to be found. I stayed in a ""staywell"" room on the 24th floor which I felt needed an upgrade. I think it's time for the Bellagio to upgrade their rooms and add technology that their competion is currently offering,"
559,5.0,Great stay.,"The resort was amazing as always, and I really enjoyed my stay. All of the staff that I dealt with were great and very helpful. I will absolutely be back in the future. The only thing I noticed was that all MGM properties seemed to have less security on site than usual which hopefully will be changed. Thank you!!"
560,5.0,Pure Delight,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our get away. There was so much to do right in the comfort of the hotel. This was my first visit to Las Vegas and the Bellagio will always be my stay of preference. Beautiful site and experience.
561,2.0,Go elsewhere,This place has gone downhill and their level of service is like staying at the Plaza… what a bad experience. And at a high level place no one even tried to make it better. I don’t need someone to kiss up but they could have at least listened to my concerns and apologized.
562,3.0,"Good, but too Smokey","This is a nice hotel in one of the best locations. I used the concierge, HVAC repair, room service, and housekeeping. Everyone was very pleasant, responsive and knew their job well. My complaint is about the smoke in the gaming area (which you had to go through to get to your room). At times it was unbearable and permeated the whole building. It really left me wonder about their filtering and ventilation system. So, I would probably not stay there again."
563,5.0,Beautiful Flowers Garden,Love to stay at the Bellagio because my family can enjoy taking endless memories pictures at the flowers garden inside the resort. Also restaurants inside the casino are so good as well from Asian foods to America and Italian foods too are all good 👍
564,5.0,Fantastic New Year's,We booked the Bruno Mars package for New Year's at the Bellaggio and it was a fantastic. The hotel is magnificent from the Chihuly ceiling at the entrance to the wonderful Christmas decorations and the home of the best show O
565,2.0,Disappointed,"Usual covid, short staffed BS! Stay here often but not anymore. Room wasn't cleaned. Never recd credit I was promised or the ones that I've earned from staying and playing at property!!! It was a very disappointing NYE experience!"
566,3.0,Subpar,"Dirty hallways and less than average room. Staff less than friendly. Room was too warm and didn’t allow temperature regulation. No fridge in room which was a major inconvenience. Other than that, it was ok"
567,4.0,Environment,The service is not as good and excellent as it used to be and cafe belagio closed at 3:00 pm!!!!!!!!!!’ Why!!!!! You try to save money by not giving good service but you lose money since people don’t come back
568,2.0,First bad time at a MGM property,"Was lied too when I booked!! Bathroom shower had a clump of hair at the bottom so couldn't have been cleaned no way, and in the middle of the bathroom floor was a piece of poop, took pictures of both and called customer service and the guy i spoke to listened then put me to hold so held for 15min before I was just hung up on!!!!"
569,3.0,Nice but not worth it.,"The place is nice but you can stay in a better place for less money. The premises are gorgeous and the views are gorgeous as long as you get one. Other than that, I was not impressed by the rooms or the cleanliness of them."
570,4.0,Good but didn't like service elevator by room,Casino was a but crowded for my taste and our room was beside the service elevator and it ran all night. Otherwise it was an excellent experience. Hotels should really re think pet policy too...my husband almost stepped in dog poo on casino floor.
571,5.0,The Suite Life!,"Decided to treat ourselves to a New Years Eve to remember by booking our first Penthouse Suite in Vegas. We were not disappointed. The suite was beautifully decorated, clean, and ever so spacious. No contact/no waiting for check-in or check-out thanks to the app, made this stay efficient. Food prices in all of the resorts are astronomical, but we would definitely do it again."
572,5.0,Very nice rooms,"Very comfortable and spacious rooms. We had the fountain view and it was amazing. The king bed was super comfortable. Room service was nice and quick. Housekeeping was awesome and hotel check in clerk was super awesome, I wish I can go back and til her"
573,3.0,"Average stay, just fine","Really just being fine. Not as good as the brand suggested. Can’t really complain a lot, but didn’t meet my expectations, considering the price is on the top level. I really expect it to be much better than it is actually"
574,5.0,"Amazing experience. Conservatory, Fountain, view of the Eiffel Tower mesmerizing.","Spending the week after Christmas at the Bellagio was amazing. Yes, it was crowded, especially trying to meander through the Conservatory as people stopped to take pictures and selfies. So worth it! Food was delicious, definitely book a dinner reservation for fountain view dining. I loved the pumpkin spice and vanilla bean smoothies. And it wouldn't be a Vegas experience without a meal at the buffet. Awesome made to order omelets! The music at the piano bar was beautiful and relaxing. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get away to rejuvenate. The pool area is beautiful, heated and open, it was lovely walking through. There were a few brave people swimming!"
575,1.0,Expensive rooms,"This hotel is beautiful from outside, but they offered you old room for ridiculous price, be sure to check the mini bar before you sleep , they charged you for snacks even if you didn't take any of them, they goin to tell you why you didn't verify what you have... and the wash the hand saying you must to report this information right away"
576,5.0,Happy country boy,For an average joe I never felt like. Didn’t belong. Staff was super friendly and helpful. The Prime steakhouse was awesome the food was phenomenal and the fountain view was spectacular. Went with my wife and another married friend couple and we all were 100% satisfied. Only thing that would have been better is if we could have stayed another couples day.
577,3.0,Not meeting expectations,"Room was not tended to on 3 separate days. Restaurant staff was rude. No availability when we presented without reservation, yet restaurant was empty. Went online to make reservations and the we got seated. Incomprehensible and poor customer service!"
578,4.0,Very nice,This is the second time we stayed at the Bellagio. We had a view of the fountain. Everything was lovely. My only complaint was that I checked out on their computer and was told I would get a receipt sent to my email which I never got.
579,4.0,Didn’t meet expectations.,"We had stayed at the Bellagio in the past, it was always fabulous however this trip they did not meet our expectations. The Bellagio is very high end and pricey and with that comes expectations. This Trip we had to ask to have our room serviced, the bed wasn’t made and the trash wasn’t taken away. Overall, a great place to stay but this time a little disappointing."
580,4.0,clean entry dirty room,"when you walk in to the hotel its beautiful and presentable when you go to the rooms its a whole different story. With the room not adequately lit you can not tell the carpet is not vacuumed the counters or end tables are cleaned properly. In day light you can see what the houskeeping staff thinks of their job, or they are over worked and understaffed or that the hotel is just not wanting to keep up the rooms especially with the possibility of the previous guest caring covid."
581,3.0,Nice but a bit disappointed,"Checked in early to the hotel but when I got there my room was downgraded and I was given another room. Then when I got into the room the TV went bad and had to be replaced within the first few hours of being in the room. Then later on that evening I heard a loud sound went into the bathroom and the tub backed up which left black stuff all in the tub. I advise the front desk but no one ever came to clean it. Then the hot water tank was leaking and had to wrap a towel around the tap to keep the water from running everywhere this to it’s not addressed. Overall beautiful hotel average rooms, and great location."
582,2.0,Housekeeping did not show for four days,"I wish I was kidding. Everyday we threw the trash outside the door; we weren’t the only ones. The hallways were littered with trash everyday. Yes at the Bellagio, a supposed five star property. The policy is for housekeeping to show every three days because of covid. Ok, if this is the policy we need: to be informed of the policy at checkin, 3 days worth of towels, 3 days worth of hand towels, 3 days worth of wash clothes, 3 days worth of shampoo, 3 days worth of conditioner, 3 days worth of body creme, an extra roll of toilet paper, more than 3 total towels in a 2 queen bed room, and more than a single bar of soap. Erik told us we could request daily housekeeping (which we did), but no one came for four days. We also need a shower that uses enough water that we’re not"
583,3.0,Noisy neighbors,"Noisy neighbors and an exceptional customer service. Our next-door neighbors were allowed we call the security twice, security worn them twice and they were still allowed till 4:30 in the morning. We checked out at 7:30 and barely had one and a half hours sleep"
584,5.0,Stellar Stay,Stay Well rooms are well appointed and quite comfortable. We actually ordered sound machines for our home. The hotel is quite beautiful and centrally located with access to Cesars by walkway and The Patk and Aria via tram.
585,5.0,Best Casino and Hotel on the Strip,The Bellagio is a beautiful Casino and Hotel. They have many wonderful restaurants with a wide variety of specialties from Steaks to Seafood. Most of their restaurants have fountain views which makes your dinner experience extra special. Every Bellagio staff member from the room housekeepers to the employees at the restaurants and the floor support members are all very nice.
586,4.0,Nice but busy,"This casino is really busy. It is in the middle of the strip so although the location is good the casino itself is really busy. there isnt a place to sit down and eat for breakfast, like a cafe. But the rooms are really nice and big. there were two windows with electronic blinds and a big window right next to the tub that I took advantage of, twice. The casino is beautiful which really draws a lot of people. And of course everything is really expensive. $6 for a bottled water at the bar. I guess that is why they call Vegas the Disneyland for adults, lol. Of course, I will be back to Vegas but I will avoid staying at the Bellagio simply because of all the people."
587,3.0,Great property with some problems,Check in was very easy through the app. Room was clean and nice. Beds are very comfortable. Housekeeping would never clean the room unless we called before leaving. They must have been busy for Christmas but still. Parking was horrible. It took us 45 min to get to self park and even longer for valet because of how long the lines were. Valet staff were rude and unfriendly. I had an experience where one of them who said his name is Rudy palini (or something similar) wouldn’t take my vehicle ( I’m gold status) and blocked the drive through lane so I couldn’t even leave. He said he was waiting for a vehicle owner to “come back with his money”. Apparently he was promised a $100 tip and allowed the guy to drive around and get 1st in line for valet. We waited 45 min to get out.
588,3.0,Disappointed,"This is supposed to be a super fine quality hotel. I stayed for five nights and they didn't clean my hotel room once. I had to request fresh towels after the fourth night and despite having four people in the room they brought two. I was given zero explanation of what the resort fee paid for. I still have no idea. The room itself was gorgeous! The bed and pillows were a dream. The location is so central we adored that part. But, for the cost you could stay at a much cheaper hotel and received better service. I was very disappointed."
589,5.0,Best hotel stay!,One of the best vacations ever. Glad we stayed at the Bellagio!! It was a great first time in Vegas experience. Walking distance to everything you could ever want or need. Will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone I know going there.
590,1.0,Run down,Horrible stay Checked out a day earlier Dinner at noodles was my tipping point Will not be staying here again Everything is overpriced u can get better value at newer casinos Most of the shops were not open as well Casino is full of smoke
591,1.0,Not worth it,"If you want to stay at a luxury hotel on the strip, go to the Wynn. We were in a spa level room and had an awful bed with mattress was even on an incline from being slept in for so long. We were also supposed to be upgraded through our booking with FIne resorts on Amex and it did not happen. Too crowded."
592,3.0,Lack of Follow-up,When you come to this venue you expect quality on every level. The room and the security staff were just not up to par. To be fair on my several previous visits it has always been a five star experience. The exception is Michael Minna's restaurant alway five start in every way.
593,5.0,Wonderful,"Wonderful as always! This is still a beautiful hotel. The gardens are wonderful, the rooms are equipped with the latest amenities, and the location can’t be beat. The hotel is central on the strip, so you’re close to all the action. If you want to resort hop it’s easy to reach all the other hotels that are worth reaching."
594,3.0,Disappointing experience,- Poor customer service from Front Desk staff - Unreliable housekeeping personnel - Room inadequately sanitized - Bo comps or change of rooms offered for the inconveniences The overall experience was disappointing. We did not feel we received for what we paid for.
595,5.0,Big but clean and comfortable,Overall it's a good place to stay and enjoying the trip or vacation. It was too crowded but organized and convenient to go around places. Rooms super cleans and cozy. I recommend this hotel to anyone.
596,5.0,Seamless!,"Great trip, great experience, great food, and the Mlife provides great discounts. The Bellagio team made for an amazing trip. The digital check in and room key worked seamlessly to avoid lengthy lines. The staff were accommodating and responsive. The shows and restaurants were amazing."
597,5.0,Best vacation ever,"Really good place to stay in Vegas, clean, the staff are very friendly and professional, the varieties in food are super good, the service on the casino are very good, and fast,the courtesy and professionalism of all the employees are amazing"
598,3.0,New Years at the Bellagio,"Don’t go to the bellagio over new year unless you want to feel like a cow. There are way too many people and it’s pure chaos. Also wait for Starbucks, restaurants, etc. were always extremely long. Not a very relaxing way to spend a vacation."
599,5.0,The best... hands down!!!,"Booking... the best Checking in... the best Our stay... the best Quiet... the best Food... the best Property...the best ""O"" show... the best, thank you Neb Gebreamlak for wonderful seats! Winning at slots... the best Check out.... the best"
600,5.0,Oasis in a busy sea of people,We stayed at Bellagio between 12/26 and 12/30 in a Bellagio Suite and absolutely loved it. The holiday decorations and reputation of the beauty of this hotel always brings in big tourist crowds and having this lovely room was truly an oasis. VIP elevators allowed us to avoid crowded paths through the casino. Staff was amazing and we at at several restaurants of which Lago and Mayfair Supper Club are standouts. We also enjoyed gaming here with the varieties of machines to play. This stay elevated our experience and though this hotel can be busy..we will definitely be back.
601,1.0,Bellagio Hotel,"Overpriced for quality of stay, not transparent in explaining charges, unwilling to help correct issue. Recommend looking at many of the other fine resorts in Las Vegas that are more cost effective, provide better service have better amenities and are more helpful in solving issues that arise. The bellagio has become an outdated place to waste your money."
602,5.0,Great as always!,"Great location, rooms and price. Close to all the activities, can walk to them. Price for what you get is very good, M-life membership makes a big difference on upgrades. Wish they didn’t have the resort fee, however all casinos are doing it"
603,4.0,Christmas getaway,"Excellent location and shopping. Nice room with a view. Food was ok. Hotel had way too much of a smoke smell, which would prevent me from staying again. Smoking section should exist so guests don’t have to walk through it to get to their rooms."
604,5.0,AWESOME!,"The strip was much busier than we expected during a pandemic, so we spent a lot of time in our room watching the fun fountain shows! Great location and a very classy hotel. It was very pretty for the holidays as well!"
605,5.0,"Beautiful hotel, great location!","Beautiful hotel, great location! The staff are friendly and efficient. We enjoyed our dining experiences at Noodles, Sadelle’s and the Bellagio Buffet. Staff very friendly Spike and Edgar were helpful in assisting my brother-in-law with an issue with their reservation. Patricia in Guest Services upgraded our room to the main tower, 20th floor with a view of the pools and gardens. We were celebrating our 40th anniversary. The upgrade was very much appreciated."
606,5.0,Wonderful hotel and casino.,"Great and unique place to stay in Las Vegas. The entire team goes out of their way to make your time there memorable and enjoyable. The swimming pool is delightful, even on chilly days. All the restaurants and food service operations are top of the line and worth every penny."
607,3.0,Not all that,Our stay was good but we took a smoking room because ours was not available at 4pm when we checked in. It smelled horrible and the casino also smelled extra Smokey. Beds were great! The hotel is just not as deluxe as we thought it would be and it was not a cheap stay.
608,5.0,It's the Center of Vegas,The Bellagio is the focal point of Vegas. With it's magnificent fountains and the Eiffel Tower across the street -- it's the go-to shot of Vegas. We had a fountain view room on the 18th floor and thoroughly enjoyed the displays. Turn the TV on to the Fountain Channel to get the music in your room to get the full experience.
609,1.0,Bellagio has bad management,"Someone broke into my room when I was out at took my iPad. The door was not lacking. Anyone could get in and out without any key; the security came and fixed it without asking to check if everything was ok inside. The rude management said that there were no cameras in the Hallway and they gave me a paper for file for Lost and Found; anyway I did lose my iPad someone stole it, a thief came to my room. Not ok."
610,5.0,Best view in Las Vegas!,"Bellagio has the best view in town! We stayed in the Stay-Well fountain view penthouse suite on the 23rd floor, and we weren't disappointed. This was the last night we were in the town, and so we saved the best for the last. We reached Bellagio a little after 3pm. There was a big line for check-in but it was moving fast because there were many counters. While we had originally booked the penthouse fountain view suite, it wasn't available, so they upgraded us to the stay-well version of the same suite which had additional amenities like air purifiers,etc in the room. Once we got up to the room, we spent the next hour just enjoying the view. The room was amazing with best amenities. It had open balconies on both sides, and we had a center view of the bellagio fountain. The room"
611,1.0,Do Not Book Here,"Rooms dirty, outrageously expensive mini bar and, staff not very friendly. Do not be hoodwinked by the outside of the casino … it looks beautiful from the outside. Rooms are barely maintained. Several room service container were in the hallway all day!"
612,5.0,overall is good,Stayed in Bellagio penthouse for X'mas eve was an unforgettable experience. We celebrated our wedding anniversary with friends there and we had lots of fun. The only minor thing was the dirty window where we couldn't took a good picture of fountain view
613,4.0,"Location was great, room seems dated.","Location of the hotel was great. Room was clean, but bathrooms seemed dated. Our sink was noisy when we turned off the water. We asked for an upgraded room and we did not get what was promised. Even though we paid for it. We did not want to wait in the long line to change rooms."
614,2.0,Lack of house keeping,For the price of bellagio this was unacceptable to never receive any house keeping for 4 days. Also the air conditioner in the room was serviced twice by maintenance but still never worked. I never received clean towels or garbage removal for 4 days
615,5.0,"The best Hotel in Vegas with exceptional customer services. Wonderful upgrade, and very friendly and professional crew.","I was traveling with my wife for a business and a short vacation on Christmas. We booked a regular king bed room, but I asked front desk for any available upgrade. The front desk lady surprised us with one of the best presidential suite on 36 floor with wonderful fountain and panoramic strip view.!! We really enjoyed our three night stay and so far it was the best vacation and business trip in Las Vegas. Thanks to Bellagio and wonderful crew. They are all very nice, friendly and professional in all department. Happy new year and wish you all a very happy Holiday."
616,3.0,Three stars,The hotel is not more than 3 star hotel to me. It doesn’t worth for the price they charge. There are many newer hotels around that area with more room facilities and better quality and lower price. That was my last time there.
617,5.0,Bellagio always Right in Point,"Great experience the minute step of the vehicle and into the property. Plenty of front desk help to check guests in, so line move fast. Does not seem to nickel and dime you with time of arrival etc. Clean and updated room. Good restaurants options on site with great service."
618,2.0,Rude staff and stinking lobby,We had multiple experiences of rude staff and a food cart left outside our room for mors than 24 hours stinking up the whole lobby without anybody paying attention after multiple complaints. Granted it was holiday week we tried a lot to work with the staff assuming they were tired and overworked but even the management didnt bother to help
619,1.0,Terrible experience,The room was so dirty and didn’t get a room service until I called. Asked for the manager to come up to my room and waited about an hour but nobody came. I have pictures from what I found in the room.
620,2.0,"Long waits, even on phone","We were seeing each other after 2 years. One from Ireland, 2 from Canada, 1 from St. Louis, and 5 from NY. We were on three separate floors. It started with the check in - There are no seats in the lobby area, most likely as it is a popular tourist spot with a lot of footfall. So, while two people wait in line to check in, the rest of us hold the access luggage and lean on whatever surface is available. It took 45 minutes. Then we discovered that any floor in the building can only be accessed if you have a key to a room on that floor. So we had to all meet in the lobby to visit each other's rooms. We decided to convene in one room and retrieve our luggage in one place, and then split up. After over 30 minutes on the phone, the bell desk picked up the call. There are no"
621,5.0,Best Vegas hotel,Still the best hotel in Vegas. They could use more upgrades . They need to reduce room rates . Buffet was closed down so finding food was a pain . Parking structure was also closed off which made it more difficult for wheel chair accessibility.
622,2.0,Unimpressive accommodations,"Bellagio is crowded, check-in line is a nightmare, smells of smokers, no convenient way to grab food, snacks, or coffee. No air circulation in bathrooms, and no private water closet. Staff was pleasant and courteous and place was clean but accommodations are lacking!"
623,4.0,Fountain View Room is special,"I know from a prior Vegas visit that making my wife happy takes little more than a good view of the Bellagio fountains. So I reserved one of these rooms and, sure enough, wife was happy. These rooms not only overlook the front of the hotel for a view of the fountains; you can also tune the in-room TV to a channel that will play music and whenever the fountain show is about to begin, switches to a simulcast of the music that the fountains are ""dancing"" to. Because the shows are at the hour and half-hour starting at 3 pm, and then every 15 minutes in the evening until midnight, that's a lot of free entertainment. My photos show the view from our room, which was #40 on the 10th floor. Although the floor was a bit low, obstructing our view a little bit, at least the room was in the"
624,5.0,David Phillips,"Rooms, dinners and customer service at check in was great. We had issues with drink services on most nights. This caused issues with enjoying the night and forced us to move to other venues that provided better service."
625,5.0,Bellagio fountain,We stay at the Bellagio every time because we love the fountain. Be sure to get a fountain view room in the high teens or low 20's so you can watch the fountains from your room. Lower numbers do face the fountain but the view is obstructed.
626,5.0,Breathtaking Bellagio,"This was our first trip after/during Covid. We were very happy with the mask mandates in the hotel. We loved 'Snacks"" for quick bites and loved '' Noodles."" Our room was comfortable and clean. Taxi/Uber service was smooth. Decor is awesome. Awesome fountain show. Loved the Patisserie for breakfast. Highly recommend it."
627,4.0,Bucket list,Came to visit my grandson and daughter…..oh..the slots were very tight….lost 6 thousand dollars hardly and bonuses …very hard to find breakfast in this hotel…long long lines…ordered coffee by room service…if your first time it is hard to maneuver the hotel…
628,1.0,Bellagio BULL,Overrated hotel. Poor views. Didn’t provide my players card after 15 requests and ID requests. No soaker tubs. Didn’t clean room properly after allowing them to do so and left the floor a mess. Security was a joke and ONLY checked one night.
629,3.0,Don't expect much service,"We arrived at 9 pm, and checked in using an app, which is very convenient. Once in the room, I called for the delivery of slippers. I was told it would be long wait of two hours, but eventually it didn't arrive even after I called twice. I had to call the 3rd time in the morning to have it sent."
630,4.0,Very good,"Although Belagio isn’t the newest hotel on the Strip, it still is very elegant, and attracts a higher end clientele. The shops are high end (no trashy/t-shirt shops), and little to zero lowlifes wandering/loitering. The fountains are still excellent and the location is good near the middle of the Strip."
631,5.0,Bellagio = Best,"Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. This was our first time in Vegas and we loved every minute. After visiting several other hotels during the daytime while walking on the strip, nothing compared to the elegance and ambience at the Bellagio. 10/10 would HIGHLY recommend."
632,5.0,Good,"This is a very good location. It is in the middle of many other hotels. We liked that the hotel was next to the Cosmopolitan, which has an ice skating rink and the Wicked Spoon. Bellagio is a very beautiful hotel and you can tell that they put a lot of work into the decorations. I wouldn't really recommend the buffet, though."
633,5.0,MARVELOUS,"This was a Christmas trip to meet up with family flying in from Kodiak, Alaska. They stayed in an Airbnb in Vegas, we of course stayed at the Bellagio, our stay was excellent , we enjoyed ourselves tremdously and the staff and eveything else , I have no words, but Thank you! WE WILL BE COMING BACK"
634,2.0,Not worth the money,"The room was dirty on check in, the staff was not professional, we were woke up each morning by the housekeepers slamming doors and talking loudly in the hallways. Needless to say I was not impressed with this hotel or the hype surrounding it for the price."
635,1.0,Poor customer service,Very disappointed with customer service during an emergency with my son becoming ill with a fever. I was literally trying to reach the front desk for 2 hrs and then got out of bed sick to confront the manager myself.
636,2.0,"No, don't do it!","No coffee in rooms, shower was not clean and looked like someone dyed their hair in there. Splashes of dirty water in shower. Room walls are paper thin so you hear everything from noisy neighbors. Room was not cleaned one day and had to work over 2 hrs. to get it cleaned. Staff is there, but do not speak or can help with a problem. Even with a reasonable room rate (for a wedding) the taxes and $45 resort fee are ridiculous. The smoke chokes you no matter where you are in the hotel. Stay in a cheaper hotel with some customer service-not the Bellagio:("
637,4.0,Bellagio at Christmas,"If you like big crowds and waiting in line for any and all meals, the Bellagio is the place for you. The cleanliness and decor/upkeep are exceptional if you are a clean freak. Christmas is a busy time and they handle it well, most people walking around the Bellagio aren't staying there, just gawking. The Christmas theme was well presented, and the Atrium was particularly a nice space for Christmas. On a negative, lines for everything...any type of food or snack. Gambling was easily accessible and plenty of space to play."
638,5.0,Bellagio stay was amazing,"The room was great! It was clean, large, and the bed was very comfortable. They also brought us a crib for our 1 year old which was very clean. The staff was amazing at check in/out and we had no issues while on property."
639,5.0,Bellagio Never Disappoints - Recommend Highly,I can’t say enough good things about Bellagio. From when you arrive and smell the clean floral scents of the resort/casino/shops to the accommodating and polite staff you can’t go wrong. Bellagio exceeds expectations in all ways. Check in and check out processes are contactless and easy to use. Great selection of resort dining. The conservatory displays are always stunning. You can’t go wrong staying at the Bellagio!
640,5.0,Excellent Stay,"Our stay was superb and we enjoyed every bit here at the hotel. This was my first time in vegas... The location, service, kind and courteous staff will only make me want to come and stay here every time I'm in vegas"
641,3.0,Not worth the hype,"Not worth the hype. Paid $350 for a room but felt like I would get a much better room at a slightly cheaper hotel, without compromising on the quality. Your mainly just paying for the brand so you can say, ""I've stayed at Bellagio""."
642,5.0,Penthouse Fountain View Suite,"we stayed here for 3 nights just before Christmas for family vacation. We were able to book the Bellagio Penthouse Fountain View Suite with the adjacent double queen room for the kids. The suite is spacious, decor is a bit dated but overall not bad. There are 3 toilets in the suite (2 in the master bath along with a bidet) and 1 in the powder room. The view of the fountain is amazing with the Eiffel tower in the background. can be a bit loud for the kids who go to sleep before midnight but for adults, it's no big deal. The HDMI input in the desk doesn't work, had to connect my Nintendo Switch directly to the back of the TV. Shower door was a bit leaky but if you turn the shower to aim more towards the inside, it's not as bad. The connecting room option for kids"
643,2.0,Poor service,Poor quality on the service. There was no cleaning through my stay. Been to lower prestige hotels and had better service. Im really dissatisfied with my experience at the hotel feel like next time i will find a different place to stay at.
644,5.0,Always exceptional,"Even with a staff recently returned from a 1-1/2 year Covid interruption and facing a Christmas week crowd, everyone performed marvelously and any ruffles were remedied quickly to our satisfaction. And no other property matches those wonderful fountains!"
645,5.0,Top notch,"No complaints, great service easy to navigate. I even put my room keys on my phone which was one of the best things!!! Housekeeping was very respectful of my things putting them neatly away. Couldn’t ask for more"
646,1.0,Not what it used to be.,"The room was very dirty with old food in the carpet and hair everywhere. We ordered room service breakfast to avoid the long lines at the Starbucks etc , usually 30mins , which seemed expensive however we assumed it must be good quality. It was not the coffee which costs $12 was undrinkable and the three pastries where really small.It also took 1 hour to arrive and the order was incorrect."
647,1.0,Poor service,"For the amount of money you pay - the service was awful. You know the type - the staff think they are better than you. I’ve got this sometimes when you go grocery shopping at some high end stores. All in all, low value for money."
648,5.0,Hotel buffet games cacino balet packing,I like you a lot I come twice a year and I feel very comfortable the staff is in a good mood and they work quickly the cleaning staff they are very attentive and friendly and the size is giant of the cacino thanks to all
649,4.0,"Beautiful hotel, very crowded","The hotel is beautiful and the room was very comfortable. Excellent coffee in the cafe - which opens pretty early. But it got very crowded during the day/evening, and it took upwards of 30 minutes to get into the parking garage. There was plenty of parking, just a lot of traffic going on to the property."
650,2.0,Nothing to write home about,"Was really expecting to be WOW! But nothing really to be impressed - the room was just a typical room. Was assigned to the 20th floor overlooking the empty pool (more of a renovation time for that area). The bed was nice and comfortable was the only highlight - because it was so windy, you could hear the wind whistling - which was annoying. Room was clean! To be expected food was expensive, and at least it was tasty. I was not able to what the fountain show as it was cancelled, and it was the main reason for us in staying there, but no special place to watch for hotel guess. So really no point in staying in this overly priced hotel."
651,4.0,Great experience,"Our stay at Bellagio was satisfactory. The room was spatial and cleaned, though the view was not great. The staff is all nice to us. We had a good breakfast at Spago, looking over the fountain and enjoying the nice weather. One downside is that it was impossible to make a reservation by the room telephone because the line was too busy. We tried several times and never reached out. But overall, it was a nice experience."
652,5.0,Absolutely amazing,"AMAZING everything was incredible and overall an amazing experience. The food, the casino, the rooms and specially the hotel. The staff were good too. We stayed here for some days and it really helped because it is also near to anything so it has a good location."
653,5.0,Umpteeth Great Visit....,"Bellagio has never disappointed me with their service. From my casino host, to the servers/bartenders, housekeeping, etc...they all provide great service. The VP machines at the Sports Bar and Baccarat bar also didn't disappoint. It turned out to be a very Merry Christmas. I love Bellagio. This is my home resort."
654,4.0,Christmas at Bellagio,Christmas decorations are phenomenal. It was easy to find a staff member for any questions. The issue Bellagio is and other hotels is no coffee in the room. The quick service coffee place is convenient but 6.25 for a latte or house coffee is pretty expensive. Other hotels seem to have more food options.
655,3.0,Rude Casino host at mLife,"Casino host was rude! Won’t stay there again… Room service was a paper sack, 89 bucks for breakfast out of a paper bag and plastic dinner ware…! Spago was good, tried to shop but vendors weren’t not to helpful."
656,5.0,"Fantastic Stay, Great Suite","Was here to get married in style! Stayed 10 days in a suite in the Spa Tower. Was pretty wonderful & fairly expensive. Room was excellent, service was as well. Food service was pretty slow, but I'm guessing covid caused shortage of staff, so wasn't too worried about it. The beds I found very comfortable, my bride wasn't as happy with the sheets. The suite furniture was just okay. If I could afford to live here, I would."
657,1.0,To expensive.,Winning in my experience is .1 percent with the slots. Rooms were over expensive with no microwave. No coffee machine. And the knobs for the shower are not under the shower head. Staff had no knowledge of where things were.
658,5.0,Best Hotel casino,This is the best place to stay on the strip plenty of restaurants to dine at . The rooms are clean thanks to the superb job that housekeeping does . As a platinum MGM card holder I give the staff at the Bellagio a 10 plus star rating
659,5.0,Great stay,"We enjoyed everything about our stay, from the room cleanliness to the holiday decorations. Staff was friendly and helpful during the entire stay. The casino was like all on the strip, but we will definitely return."
660,3.0,Vacation,Rooms were ok. Check-in is a disaster. Long lines. App does not register more than one room.Cleaning of rooms is a disaster. Amenities are like a 2 star hotel. Will try Wynn next time. We had 6 rooms booked for our family.
661,5.0,Happy place,"Stay at bellagio almost once every month now , good food , super clean, poker room is fantastic, shopping mall is amazing , good value for the money spend, show is great , restaurant is wonderful, happy place"
662,2.0,Disappointment on the Strip,"Unfortunately our stay before the holidays at the Bellagio was very disappointing. We understand that during the pandemic many businesses are struggling with staffing. It was more than clear that the Bellagio is one of those businesses. Upon arrival we were unable to get assistance with our luggage and the line at check in was incredibly long and not moving rapidly. We chose the self check in with the app since we couldn't get help with luggage. There were several occasions we could've used assistance with housekeeping, issues with our room, etc. We tried calling the front desk several times with no answer. It was completely frustrating that we couldn't get any assistance. We had done our research and the Bellagio was one of the higher priced rooms during our stay, which"
663,3.0,Decent Stay,"Stayed with my fiance for christmas week. Xmas garden display was beautiful. Room was nice except for dirty vents in bathroom. Neighbors room service cart stayed infront of our door for 2 days had to call front desk to have it removed. Staff could have been friendlier. Cafe was best part of trip. Delicious coffee and pastries. The buffet was good. Line is long to get in so make sure you get Pearl status on Mlife rewards to cut the line. Pearl statu also gets you free self parking at all MGM locations. Parking can get difficult at night. Alot of people show up to see the water fountains. Be prepared to pay resort fees on top of your room reservation up to $45 a day, resort fee tax up to $6.95 a day and incidentals fees up to $150 a day. Incidentals are refunded after your stay"
664,5.0,Nice hotel and accommodation,Cleaned and hotel staff is nice especially front desk for check in and check out. Room service is good and it is accessible to other hotels very quickly. Fountain show was amazing and my kids enjoyed…
665,3.0,price-performance ratio is not right,"Bathroom with water stains, a bottle of water 22$ and beside the room rate a daily resort fee of 51$, everything too expensive. In the Casino every where smoke of cigarette. Any kind of coffee over 6.50$"
666,5.0,Two days to celebrate a Raiders victory!,"All facets of my stay at The Bellagio were exceptional. I visit Vegas on average three times a year and the accommodations are far superior to other options. Specifically, the staff is friendly and professional and the comfort of the beds is unmatched. It is my favorite home away from home!"
667,3.0,Rooms need renovation.,"The Bellagio is very beautiful! but if you are staying in one of their rooms it’s not so lavish as you think. The bedrooms definitely need to be renovated and fixed. I had issues in my bedroom with the shower being broken and getting the floors all wet, and a lot of other issues that relate to an older hotel."
668,5.0,Good memories of 2021,"If you like come to LV then you should book with Bellagio , you could have the best service and wonderful day with this family and friends, we had a wonderful Christmas holiday weekend with family here."
669,3.0,Alright stay,"The room my family (w/kids) got was nice. Bed was comfortable, wish the pillows were more fluffier. The bathroom had a walkin shower which was very nice. The only down about this hotel is that there is smoking within the casino and there isnt any regular restaurants for breakfast or dining. They have a snack shop that is open late but there is mainly pizza, burgers and hotdogs that is overpriced. We had to order food from uber eats just to get something decent. Overall experience was good."
670,5.0,One night stay,We had a stop over in Vegas on our Christmas drive from Salt Lake to Phoenix to visit family. I would definitely stay here again. The food at Michael Mina's was incredible and we had a corner room with huge windows facing the pool and the mountains.
671,5.0,Comidas,"In room service dining was awful and and dining at Sadelle’s was also awful. The food had no taste, Onion soup was cold and fried chicken burnt. My overall experience in food was a 3; what else can I say other than dining at hotel was not great."
672,1.0,Our key let us in someone else’s room!,"So many problems. First, our key let us in another person’s room! Valuable electronics in full view. Major security issue. We had to call 3 different numbers to finally reach someone to change the key. And then it would not work in the elevator. Over an hour later we finally got in our room. We requested blankets and they never came. It was very noisy all night, not because of the people but because of very little insulation. To top it all off, there was a random heavy bench in front of the bed that my fiancé tripped over in the middle of the night and hurt his knee badly, so then had to get ice, go buy Advil in the middle of the night. The hotel made a lot of money off us with super expensive earplugs to drown out the hotel noise and on the Advil for their precariously placed"

674,5.0,Luxurious stay and perfect location,"Spacious, elegant rooms. Stayed in the Spa Tower, which was really quiet and came with whirlpool bath. Perfect location on the Strip and I loved how the resort went all out for holiday decorations. Also, Bellagio has complimentary tram to Aria and Park MGM."
675,1.0,Overpriced,"Room had little to no view, overpriced stay with little to no service. We spent 25 mins trying to self park in the overfilled parking lot, had to ""find"" our own bellhop cart because none was available at the front desk and make our way to our abysmal room. Overcrowded and filled to the brim, with everything being overpriced. No one cared or bothered about the customer experience except for the janitorial staff which was very polite and eager to be of help."
676,4.0,Rude Front Desk,The front desk was rude! Robert (General Manager) offered his sincere apology on behalf of his staff(s) and corrected the mistakes! He also offered to waive two nights of resort fees! The room was clean and comfortable!
677,5.0,Best hotel/casino in Vegas,"Everything was great, clean, friendly staff great food, and best casino,poker room and sports book in vegas.i really truly mean it. When you go to other hotels besides Wynn and Aria, you will see the difference.very clean room and great strip view,"
678,5.0,Wonderful Experience!,"Stayed at the Bellagio for the first time from Dec 19th-22nd and had a pretty great visit! The Conservatory was decorated with seasonal floral sculptures and made the entire lobby smell of fresh pine — a touch of holiday magic that we personally LOVED. Amazing photo opps, but had a lot of foot traffic most times as it’s open to the public (we made it a point to go super early one morning to grab some pics, go before 10am to avoid the large crowds!) The buffet was also well worth the price. Delicious foods, covering breakfast/lunch/dinner and a wide range of cuisines, fresh fruits and yummy desserts! 100% will be staying here again."
679,4.0,Excellent visit,"Excellent stay, decent gaming but need better slot selection, food is good but over priced though this is expected given the property. Staff is very friendly and housekeeping and room service staff is top notch!"
680,5.0,Christmas in Vegas,"We always stay at Bellagio when we get to Vegas. The decorations, the great staff, the central location on the strip is what works for us. The staff is knowledgeable, professional, and attentive to our needs. With the current covid situation, it was a relief to see numerous staff members remind visitors to wear their masks and to provide one if necessary. Many of the places that we visited did not."
681,5.0,Stay of Bellagio,"My wife and I spent 3 days before Christmas and were pleasantly surprised with the total experience, from check-in to loading our luggage back into our car. Even though the crowds were much larger than anticipated, we felt comfortable inside the casino. We loved the newly remodeled rooms too."
682,5.0,Bellagio in December,"We enjoyed our December stay at the Bellagio. It was wonderful from the décor of the newly remodeled rooms with spectacular views of the fountains, to the beautiful Christmas decorations. We highly recommend both Noodles and Sadelle's Cafe."
683,5.0,wonderful,"wonderful, room, location staff food, everything was 5 star we will be back for sure. It was safe, clean, covid protocols were followed. The food and staff were friendly, room with soaking tub was incredible."
684,3.0,Go To See the Fountains,"Even. if not staying at this hotel, make a point to go and see the fountains. They are pretty spectacular and definitely worth a visit to the hotel. The common areas of the hotel were pleasant and well appointed."
685,4.0,Scarce Coffee,There is no place for a quick cup of coffee. The Bellagio needs a Starbucks type place. The pastry place is not equipped to handle a large volume of traffic. The Spa Tower rooms are not nearly as nice as the others.
686,5.0,What a great experience,"To the check in, trying to get a limo, buffet experience, to check out - all the customer service representatives that we ran into were exceptional. I did not have one negative encounter. I do wish they had a full dresser available. I stayed with my family (2 adults and 2 children) for five nights and there was not enough space for us to unpack so we had to live out of our suitcases."
687,3.0,Shocked that a five-star resort could be so dirty,Shocked that a five-star resort could be so dirty. The staff was very busy and couldn’t answer my call when I tried to call and complain about my room’s cleanliness so I just decided to clean it myself. There was old food and cup rings left on all the surfaces. There was dust and black smudges on a few areas and under the phone as if no one moved to ever wipe under them. I just was extremely astounded that I had to clean a place of such a reputation also I ended up with a dirty coat because where I placed it on the chair there were crumbs and old food I hadn’t seen before.
688,5.0,Best in Vegas!!!,Look no further Bellagio is the place to stay on your next Las Vegas trip! Thank you Bellagio for excellent customer service. I’ve been loyal customer for couple of years and never did I get disappointed with their services. I would say all MGM properties are top of my list but Bellagio is my go to place.
689,5.0,bellagio is the place to go,"great rooms, easy check-in process and friendly staff. location is in central part of the strip and it's easy to reach other destinations from the resort. restaurants are very good, including the buffet. the prices and resort fees are a bit steep, but i suspect that's the case with most of the resorts in vegas these days."
690,4.0,Recent Visit,"Would have been a ""5"" if housekeeping cleaned the room more often...Everything else was excellent! Updated rooms are a plus. View of the fountains was incredible. Bathroom and Shower vary spacious and roomy and included two sinks and a magnifying mirror. ALL Staff extra courteous and friendly."
691,2.0,Disappointing,"The only reason we stayed here was for their Suite. It was ok. Their catering and other policies are a waste of everyone's time. It's so annoying to get nickled and dimed when you are spending over $1k on a room a night. Their towels belong in the garbage not in a ""luxury"" hotel. Overall, I was not please with my experience and would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury experience."
692,4.0,Almost perfect!,"To be clear, I would have no problem recommending Bellagio, nor would I have any qualms re-visiting at some future date. Bellagio is a magnificent property worthy of a five star resort. During a recent stay in room #23064, there were a couple items that warrant improvement. (1) The water pressure in the shower and at the sinks was very low, increasing the amount of time to complete the task at hand. If the reduced water pressure was intentional in an attempt to save water resources, the logic is misguided. Reduced water pressure increases the amount of time to finish the job thus using more water. (2) With the introduction of new ultra plush mattresses, someone forgot to consider if the flat sheet, typically used as the bottom sheet, would fit. The current reality is that"
693,1.0,Too much Cigarette Smoke,The entire hotel and room smell like smoke. So it was very hard to breathe in our room because of all the cigarette smoke circulating. Our room was had a big stain on the couch and the carpet was not clean.
694,1.0,Out of date and dirty room,"The room was out of date, shower head was super dirty. Toilet seat and bath tub were yellow. They described the room view as strip view but we had a parking view. Two dirty glasses were on the floor when you enter the room. I am so disappointed and I do not recommend it. It was my first and last time at this hotel."
695,5.0,Overall great stay !,Overall great experience. Would stay again at this property. Had minor issues with housekeeping and spa billing. Expected better service based on the room type selected. Had to wait for the rooms to be ready.
696,5.0,Beautiful place to trip to Las Vegas.,"Bellagio Las Vegas is a beautiful place to visit , nice room nice place to sleep , pretty decoration, swimming pools good restaurants with nice piano music shows and beautiful Fountain music and songs ."
697,4.0,Beautiful Hotel but crowded in Casino,"The check in was easy & fast even though there was a line. The room was clean & spacious. The buffet was top notch, so many selections. The self parking was affordable at $18 a night. I was so pleased to see that mask wearing was enforced in the casino & lobby during this horrible pandemic. Only complaint, the casino was crowded & saw way to many dogs walking around. Overall experience was great."
698,5.0,A great place to stay on the strip,"A great and classy place to stay when you want to enjoy great views of the strip and want to enjoy great food and great service. The location is amazing and Bellagio is at a walking distance from most of the great restaurants. Of course, one can't forget about great fountains of Bellagio. In all, staying at Bellagio will make your Vegas trip even more memorable."
699,5.0,Birthday vacation success!,So many restaurants to pick from and room service is 24/7. Casino was great! Bars were awsome! From the first day to the the last day everything went soo smoothly and fun that i wanted to extend my stay!!
700,5.0,Professional & Courteoud,"After 6 years decided to go to Vegas and Bellagio came at the top of our list. Front desk, Housekeeping & in house dining were exceptional. Staff were so helpful and attentive to our needs. Rooms were immaculate."
701,5.0,A stay at Bellagio during Christmas,My family had a wonderful time at Bellagio. It is conveniently located in the middle of the strip and surrounded by delicious restaurants. We sat at the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant (Paris casino) having dinner and enjoyed the water dancing across the street at Bellagio. It was very relaxing to watch the water and listening to the Christmas music. It was pricey to stay at Bellagio but my kids said that it was well worth it compared to other hotels.
702,5.0,Viva Las Vegas,"Join the Mlife program if you gamble. Free room,free play, hotel credit and express comps and free parking. We stayed Bellagio was great! Arlene Sigua is player representative Great asset, very knowledgeable Asigua@mgmresorts.com That’s your insider in Vegas!"
703,4.0,Great time but Valet service RUINED the experience. Extremely understaffed!!! 30 min wait just to park vehicle each t,"Extremely understaffed!!! It took 30 min wait just to park vehicle each. Over the weekend, totally 3 hrs of sitting in line waiting to park my vehicle. Staff apologized but there was not attempted to fix the issue over the 4 days."
704,5.0,Extremely comfortable beds.,"This hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff were very friendly, the room was very clean, the bed was so comfortable. Our safe didn't work and had to be replaced, but they had that fixed in no time at all and gave us 50.00 in resort credit."
705,3.0,Overrated,Room was nicely appointed and location on the strip is great. However they cleaned our room once on a 4 night trip and that was after we requested multiple times. Shower has zero water pressure and you couldn't even wash yourself. Totally overrated properly. We won't pay to stay there again.
706,5.0,Bellagio - December 2021,"Hotel is still not up to pre-COVID standards but is better than it was in July 2021. Still need reservations in most restaurants and they are not always easy to get even ahead of time and other services such as housekeeping, beverage service on casino floor, etc. seem to be affected by staffing issues."
707,2.0,Disappointed,"Having not been to the Bellagio since the start of the pandemic, I was surprised by how the hotel has aged. The check in process was a total disaster - even having reserved a presidential suite. Despite not being able to access our room until 7pm, we were charged $100 for a 1pm late check out."
708,5.0,Best view in Vegas,The fountain view at the Bellagio hotel is the absolute best view in Vegas. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are beyond comfortable. It’s like your on the strip while looking outside your hotel room.
709,4.0,1st Bellagio stay,Beautiful but expensive hotel. If I could afford it I would stay again. This was a comp stay. I loved the contactless check-in! The room key in your phone was cool too! The location of the hotel is perfect!
710,4.0,Bellagio is Bellagio,You will not be disappointed at Bellagio. Reason for one of the top hotels in Vegas. The only downside was that I was charged for the food and snack that I have never used during the stay. Good that the customer service Dept was able to get me a refund for the charges. Definitely keep your eyes on the bill.after check out.
711,1.0,Looks amazing. THAT'S IT,"Bellagio looked amazing. You needed to go see it for once. The night time fountain show was good. THAT'S IT!!! Here comes the bad part, I will keep this simple. Beds too hard, pillows shrinks, shower pressure blows for god sake, like what da fak is this. Good job at saving 5 gallons of water from a quick 5 mins shower and made me took a bath for 50 gallons of water. Casino games ranged from $50-100 bucks a game. Rarely see happy crowds there because people were there to GAMBLE not pleasure. Same MGM property, I would recommend going to Park MGM. Everything is way better at Park MGM and smoke free."
712,3.0,Two day stay at Bellagio,Well appointed but too crowded for our tastes. We wanted to stay at the Aria but the room accommodations were unavailable. Choice of restaurants were not as diverse as at the Aria. Food options limited compared to the Aria as well.
713,5.0,Beautiful Bellagio,"We hadn't been to Vegas at Christmas before, and it was so beautiful :). Had an amazing fountain view from one of the newly renovated rooms. Did the lunch buffet for the first time in years. I think we'll try the dinner next time :) One of our favorite places to say in Vegas!"
714,4.0,"Luxurious, center of the Strip action, low quality quick food options, crowded.","I love the Bellagio. Great, clean rooms. Close to all the actions. Only issues I had were that my mom had some keycard issues where her keycards would stop working. Even her mobile app wouldn't work. The ""Snacks"" eatery is the only Quick Service-style dining and the food quality was pretty meh. I was hounded by the BetMGM people to join the app to get free drink coupons. When I went to go claim them for a drink, a non-alcoholic drink at that, I was denied. My mom wanted a virgin pina colada and the bartender said that the drink doesn't work with the coupon, which doesn't make any sense to me since there's no alcohol in it and I would imagine it's cheaper. Just a really dumb waste of time so I didn't even end up using it because the bartender was kind of rude too."
715,5.0,Bellagio is A+,"Stayed for 3 nights , the Conservatory for the holidays is gorgeous !!! Sadelles is so delicious we ate there twice! One time was a cheeseburger and the next huevos rancheros which were amazing. Noodles and Bellagio Patisserie was good too. We mainly go for craps, roulette and slots, we had an amazing time as usual. No wins this time but already planning our next trip! L"
716,3.0,5 star hotel with a 3 star service,"the property is really nice as always Grade location and central in the strip The restaurants were amazing So, lot of positives. But, my friends and I checked in at the VIP checkin and the people were not friendly. Maybe they forgot they work in the VIP area. Also. My friends and I played in the VIP room and the staff was not the friendliest, including the floor people and the dealers. Seems like they were more interested in socializing. Maybe they forgot that they are working and thay people are playing big money. Respect the players. Just saying"
717,5.0,Good times,"Excellent vacation time. Very clean rooms beautiful views. Loved the restaurant. Breakfast buffet was fantastic , so much food to enjoy Fun casino . We enjoyed every minute of it. Definitely going back next vacation!!!"
718,5.0,Bellagio - Staywell Room,Bellagio is one of the best hotels on the strip. Staywell rooms are newly renovated with high quality service. Whole floor was smoke free and had pleasant aroma. Mobile check-in process was very convenient and never felt a need to go to concierge.
719,5.0,Dreamland,Everything was the great! This was a great vacation. It was perfect. A dream came true. Our room was overlooking the fountains. Pools were great. Staff were kind and helpful. Food was great. Tram was convenient.
720,3.0,I would look somewhere else for FHR perks,"They offered an ""upgrade"" upon REQUEST which was more of a downgrade, so I refused it. Shower felt cold, low pressure water, and little that I felt a bit cold thru the shower session. Also one of the sinks would make a loud ""gulping"" (sounded more like water going through a clogged pipe) noise through the day and night, was awakens through the night for that noise, until I got used to.. In overall, with my Plat perk, I would try somewhere else."
721,1.0,Worst hotel ever!,We’ve been to many time going to Vegas. Bellagio is dated and we had worst hotel experience ever had. “Newly Updated” room shower was super low pressure and wasn’t clean. Air freshener pump under the sink was broken and leaking. Sink was clogged and stinky.
722,5.0,Great stay as usually! Fountain room view is amazing!,"Great rooms, great slots, mlife cards are definitely worth it! Comps are amazing staff takes care of you there, drink servers could be more readily available but overall experience was great definitely will be booking for the up coming year"
723,5.0,Easy check-in and out,Easy check-in and out with the MGM app. Bypass all lines out at front desk. Staff really helpful and knowledgeable. Feel safe with Covid-19 protocol in place. Room was standard but really clean. Will be returning for sure.
724,3.0,Rocking toilet,"I had a congested nose every time i walked in to the room. Loose or rocking toilet. We order room service one time for breakfast and two dinner after returning from Bryce and zyon we were exhausted . Food and service was great. Buffet was also appetizing. We noticed heavy cigarette smoke and smell, we compared to other hotels in the area."
725,5.0,Awesome Hotel,It was so nice and in a perfect location we were able to walk to sight see and shop. The fountains were beautiful and the buffet was the best I’ve ever had at a hotel. Also rooms were clean and room service were so helpful.
726,5.0,Amazing and Beautiful,"My family and I booked a room at the Bellagio for the second time. The room service staff were very accommodating to our requests for more bath and bed items since we’re a family of 5 and the room is “meant for 2 people.” The rooms are kept very clean and we thankfully were able to snag one with a fountain view. Although you’re not able to hear the music, it was nice to look at the fountain from a different perspective. Bellagio is always a must to go to everytime we head to Las Vegas, especially for their seasonal garden changes. The Noodles restaurant inside the hotel serves consistently good stir fry food and their steamed rice is always nice and fluffy. Sadelle’s is also a good restaurant to stop by. We didn’t know you could order takeout in either of these restaurants until"
727,1.0,Might As Well Be Motel 6,"Dirty, smelly, dingy room with peeling wallpaper, cracked tile in bathroom, and the toilet was broken at check-in as well as after the hotel deemed it to be fixed. The hotel had so many non-guests parked in their garage that the guests had significant problems finding a place to park."
728,5.0,I love Bellagio!,"We often think of trying a different casino when we visit Las Vegas but just can’t! Bellagio is perfect. From their beautiful decor, their many restaurants, service, rooms, beds. Bellagio is a wonderful experience."
729,5.0,The Bellagio is Amazing,"The Bellagio is absolutely amazing! The rooms are beautiful. The fountains are stunning and I love that it is close to everything. There's an abundance of restaurants, shops, shows, etc to choose from without even leaving the hotel."
730,4.0,It’s a Beautiful and comfortable place to stay,"Bellagio is it beautiful and a comfortable place to stay. In the resort, I’ve already enjoying the artist design of the lake, the fountain, the garden, The lobby and then the whole building. The best the location also gave me that great view of Las Vegas night and day"
731,2.0,Poor,"It is not the same Bellagio any more. The rooms are not clean. The sheets have stains, window glass is dirty, the bathroom handle was broken. I would highly recommend wynn. It is cheaper than Bellagio but is way more technologically advanced. The rooms and the resort gave us a more relaxing and fun experience at a cheaper price."
732,5.0,Vegas Getaway,"Bellagio is located in the middle of the strip making it perfect walking distance to any other hotel or attraction on the strip. At the hotel, there is a variety of restaurants, shopping and attractions to see. Rooms are very comfortable and clean."
733,5.0,"Amazing property, Frendly staff, prime location","Amazing property, friendly staff, prime location! Would definitely come here again. It was my girls favorite hotel in Vegas so far and we have stayed at numerous hotels in Vegas! Amazing restaurants and shopping!"
734,5.0,Fantastic,"Check in was a breeze and very friendly. Our room was very nice, clean and had a beautiful view of the strip and fountain. The bathroom was huge and everything worked fine. The king size bed was super comfortable as well as the pillows. House keeping was great and everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The pool and hot tub were awesome with the pool heated to a comforting level. The Christmas decorations everywhere were beautiful and must have taken a lot of work. There are a lot of gambling options and the drink service was very good. Room service was pretty quick and our food was excellent. We can't wait to go back."
735,5.0,Compassion of Housekeeping,"Housekeeper Mary Padilla is very professional and understanding in terms of working with elderly people who require extra attention. She was able to relate to having older relatives. This includes providing a bathtub chair, slippers, bathrobe, etc."
736,4.0,Hard to rate,"Is is challenging to rate. On the one hand it is a wonderful hotel with over the top experience. On the other hand it comes with a large price tag. I hadn’t been to Vegas since 2013. It sure seemed more affordable then. We stayed at Bellagio and after our first night we walked down the strip and visited Luxor and New York, New York. Don’t get me wrong, Bellagio was beautiful and massively sprawling complex with polished stonework throughout. My real problem is that it feels as though they want to just empty your pockets and send you on your way. I expected to leave my money roll there, however I don’t remember it being like this. There are no comps for food or drinks. Full price on everything. ($17+ tip was a common price for a single shot amongst the 3 casinos we visited."
737,4.0,Amazing experience,"Good location, service, casino floor, facilities. Nice fountain & strip view. Friendly environment feels like home. At the center of strip, walking distance to other decent hotels, hotel provided more than enough face masks, sanitizers during this difficult period, felt safer with this additional service. I enjoyed my stay here and will come back in my near future."
738,5.0,Winter break,"Our experience at Bellagio from start to finish was simply amazing. The front staff was super courteous, friendly and accomodating. The rooms were fantastic. The view from our window was unbelievable. We stayed up all the way till midnite just watching all the fountain shows. The Christmas exhibit by the lobby was very memorable, my kids will be talking of this trip for the rest of their lives!"
739,5.0,A nice get away,It had been a long time being cooped up due to covid lockdowns and not being able to travel we felt it was a much needed trip to just relax and get away. Everything was so beautiful and relaxing. The beds were so comfortable to sleep in; best sleep we’ve had in forever! We never stayed at Bellagio before and frankly was a bit intimidated but everyone was very friendly and nice. Our room was a fountain view room so we enjoyed the water show with wonderful music synced thru the tv in our room. Thank you for a very pleasant experience.
740,4.0,Lovely property - water pressure was a serious issue,Bellagio is a world famous hotel on the strip and the hotel lives up to its billing. Rooms were spacious and facilities were exceptional. The only issues we had were the very poor water pressure and air conditioning which was sub par. A fantastic view of the fountains and strip was somewhat let down by the bathroom which although looked amazing didn’t live up to the hype. Water basically piddled out and was not even useful for a decent shower which was super disappointing due to the fact it was an amazing double walk in shower. Cason o is fun and very decent restaurants and bars to choose from. I’d recommend it but need to ensure that they fix the water pressure problem and also getting the air conditioning to work properly.
741,5.0,Fabulous anniversary,"We had an awesome 32nd Anniversay. The staff from the front desk checking us in, to the four restuarants we dined in, to all the bars we played video poker were ""BEST IN CLASS"" in customer service. Our room was fabulous and the housekeeping was exceptional."
742,5.0,My problem,"I have described the billing problem on the previous page with MLife. I am still over charged $538.10 (told that was a security deposit and will be refunded to me when check out). Up to now, 3 days after check out, I have not received the refund."
743,5.0,Still classy esp with the new renovations,Love the new room renovations. Classy and functional. Great shower big shower. Tubs are gone. Still kills me no coffee makers or fridge in the room (although there is a little space on top that holds 5 beers. Great location and easy to get a taxi and cab. Fountains are awesome as always.
744,5.0,Grand,"The hotel was very nice, only concerns is what I addressed. Better information the resource services like Urber, & Ltfy, The taxis service overcharged us, additing additional charges and didn't want to give a receipt."
745,5.0,Truly Paradise,"A very special trip for my girl friend and I. Of special mention Shirili Bless VIP Services, Bonnie VIP Lounge, Joshua Transportation Manager and all the other wonderful people who work at the Bellagio. We were treated wonderfully by everyone, and dinner at the Prime Steakhouse on the patio great and the Cirque du Soleil ""O"" were great."
746,1.0,Blood in Room,"My first stay at Bellagio, something I've wanted to do ever since they opened. We were fountainside, which was really cool. Unfortunately, we discovered dried blood in our room on the couch and in the bathroom. I asked three times for it to be cleaned up. Some was, but I ultimately had to finish the job myself. The front desk was very helpful each time I discussed it with them. The problem seemed to be with housekeeping, who not only missed it the first time, but then couldn't properly follow the tickets opened by the front desk. If housekeeping missed obvious bloodstains while ""cleaning"", what else did they miss? I wouldn't have been shocked to see this at some roadside motel, but this was Bellagio! It was very disconcerting, especially in these times of COVID-19. I've"
747,4.0,Quick trip,Let’s start with the gambling part. Lol the floor at the Bellagio has a great selection of games. We did really well on the first night that the machines were very tight the second night. We literally gambled all day and hit nothing. Staff/service is excellent! Well managed. Rooms were ok. Bed wasn’t in best of shape. Poor water pressure. But they just updated some. Easy to get to right off the freeway. Overall good experience. I would recommend.
748,3.0,"Great hotel and casino, but the room experience wasnt anything compared to the Cosmo","Great hotel and casino, but the room experience wasnt anything compared to the Cosmo. Great food options around. Cafe is great. Love the art and culture and the shows. Didn't love the cleanliness of the room"
749,4.0,Knicks and knacks,"Few minor issues with the room, broken faucet handle, no pressure shower head, but other than that check in process is an ease through app, love the digital key and check out process, will stay again."
750,5.0,Amazing!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Out of all the hotels I’ve stayed at, Bellagio was the best thus far!!! I have always wanted to stay at Bellagio and I’m so happy that I had my chance. Very clean, great services and very nice and friendly staff…. We will definitely stay here again and again and again!!!!"
751,5.0,Magnificent property,"Everything in this hotel is fabulous. The decor, the ambiance, the cafes. It is truly a five-star resort! We live in Summerlin so enjoyed this ""stay cation"" very much. Can't wait to return when the weather is warmer to use the pool areas."
752,5.0,Fun Vegas Weekend,Everything about our stay at Bellagio was perfect. We arrived a little earlier than check in time; however our room was ready and we were able to head straight to the room. We had a view of the fountains which were amazing to watch from the room.
753,5.0,Weekend getaway,"My girlfriend and I went for a quick weekend getaway. The room was extremely clean, the bed was very comfortable, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, the casino is a ton of fun. Will definitely stay here again."
754,5.0,Magnificent!,"Our first time stay at the Bellagio was an experience to be remembered for the rest of our lives. If you have never stayed here, you simply must make a point. The staff was always pleasant and very helpful. The food was delicious, our room was a king with a view of the fountains. The nighttime lighted view of the Strip was incredible! No need to stand outside in the crowd to watch the fountain displays. We saw it all from our 11th floor room."
755,5.0,Our Vegas go-to property,"In my opinion, one of the best properties in Vegas. Some notable characteristics: - their mlife rewards program is extensive and opens up room & dining options across the strip - everything about them is held to an incredibly high standard - and it shows. staff are friendly, the property is clean, and food is great (who knew that our favorite açaí bowl ever would be from their in-room dining menu?) - accessible transportation to neighboring properties via the tram - updated rooms and great dining options (we love sadelle's and prime in particular) - dog-friendly! we wish they had more accommodations for dog travelers (outdoor walk/park areas), but given that Vegas has historically and still is not very dog friendly, we appreciate that Bellagio gives visitors the option of"
756,4.0,Fountains!,"Nice hotel. We paid significantly more for fountain view. We had one, but 8th floor very obstructed view. Buffet was OK. But dirge and go to caesars. Line for buffet at 1030 was 30 minutes. Then 30 minute line for an omelet. All other food was Luke warm at best."
757,5.0,Exceptional,"The staff is very kind, attentive, friendly, helpful and exceptional. The atmosphere and decorations for the Christmas Holidays were very lovely and well thought out. I highly recommend The Bellagio for all events."
758,3.0,No longer the best hotel on the strip,"Hotel is antiquated. Not a great sports book. Food options are limited and extremely overpriced.I would say that 10+ years ago, this was one of the better places to stay on the strip but the times have caught up with them."
759,5.0,Great Hotel! Evrything is wonderful.,The Hotel is great. From the front desk who are all very helpful and polite. The casino is clean. The surroundings is beautiful. Everybody are very pleasant. The rooms are clean. The beds are very comfortable. The valet parking is very convenient. The bell boys are very nice. So happy to stay at this hotel!
760,5.0,Excellent Hotel,Received excellent service. Great bed and very clean room. Restaurants were excellent especially Spago and Sadelle’s. Make reservations for meals to save wait times! Only challenge is long walk to rooms which is common to most properties in Las Vegas.
761,5.0,Best stay ever,Every single employee I interacted with was very professional and kind. It's unusual to have so many polite people working at one location. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. I'm very pleased with my experience at the Bellagio. Thank you to everyone there.
762,5.0,Bellagio on top,"I have stayed at the Bellagio several times over the past few years, and their accommodations are top notch. On my last prior trip, I said that they had missed the mark, because of the location of my suite, which had a terrible view. I spoke with the hostess, and made sure that this time would be better, and she accommodated. The rooms are up to date, bright, spacious and thoroughly enjoyable."
763,5.0,Family Vaca!!!,"Great room, helpful staff, loved the Bellagio and the location on the strip. Only thing missing was an inexpensive family restaurant nearby for fast food. Ended up eating at other casinos food courts. BUT would definitely stay here again."
764,5.0,Gorgeous hotel right in the center of the strip,The Bellagio was beautifully decorated for Christmas with an amazing display near the atrium . The rooms are amazing and spacious with several amenities . The staff was very attentive and helped you find your way around different places. We had a fountain room with amazing views of the fountains . We will definitely be returning in a few months to stay with them again !!’n
765,5.0,Highly recommended,The front desk is hectic at times but they handle your every need. The hotel is clean and they pay attention to cleanliness. We felt safe from Covid and the staff is friendly and helpful. Cannot wait to visit again soon. Great place!
766,4.0,Problem with checkout,They told things I don't drink during my stay at the hotel but is great place and good price and excellent employees and big rooms for peoples that travel with family great bed for excellent night sleep
767,3.0,overrated,"Room very dusty and furniture are outdated, lack of appreciation to loyal customers, no exciting restuarant like celebrity chef. Still a great location in the strip and best hotel displays in LasVegas."
768,5.0,Barking Dog,"Love the hotel, could not sleep due to dog barking, don’t have any good comenta due to the lack of sleep. This issue went on for some time, had very high hopes for this stay. Don’t know if I could ever stay there"
769,4.0,Be aware that Resort Tower King is in Spa tower,"Nothing wrong with spa tower but it would be more professional if the hotel could let guests know in which tower their room will be during the reservation. The reality is that you know your tower only after check in. Spa tower is on the way to Vdara and it’s quiet, also more convenient to pool and monorail, but far from casino. Otherwise everything is good, still the best hotel in Vegas"
770,5.0,Christmas Beauty,The Bellagio is a beautiful place at Christmas time. Decorations galore with festivities in town to match. We attended a concert plus took in all the sights and sounds of the season. It was a memorable weekend‼️
771,1.0,Ran Down,"Prestigious but ran down and overpriced. Had a few issues with our room. Never was fully satisfied based on the price we had to pay. The prime steakhouse was amazing and is highly recommended for anyone. The meal was $420 for two people, but the best meal I have ever had."
772,5.0,Great vacation,"My wife and I have been visiting Vegas annually (or more) for 40 years. Beat trip ever. Casino dealers and equipment were first rate. Meals were excellent. Supper club was one of our best evenings out ever. Room and service were wonderful. Pricey, but worth it."
773,5.0,Will be back soon.,My wife and I stayed at Bellagio recently and all I can say is we had an amazing experience. We had friends staying there aswell and had no complaints at all. Will definitely book my next stay soon. I really recommend to book your stay at bellagio on your next Vegas stay.
774,5.0,Why Would You Stay Anywhere Else?,"Amazing experience, as always. Bellagio is the centerpiece of the Vegas Strip. In my opinion, the best place to stay to be close to everything. There are obviously other quality options on the strip (and some further from the strip), but Bellagio seems to be the perfect location. It will always be my first choice. And how can you beat a room with a view of the fountains?"
775,5.0,Even nicer than imagined,"Booked room & show for daughter's 21st birthday, hotel was well beyond our expectations and everyone we encountered on the staff were wonderful.. delightful memorable experience for all of us. Thanks."
776,5.0,Luxury stay with wonderful service,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff, luxury accommodations, comfortable bed, beautifully appointed room, nice amenities. Easy check-in process, easier check-out process. Our only issue was the need to make reservations for all of the restaurants days ahead. The patisserie, however had fast service and very yummy food available with little wait for breakfast and lunch."
777,5.0,A Class Above,"My wife and I stayed at the Bellagio last week and were very pleased with the hotel compared to others on the strip we've stayed at. The rooms, service, restaurants are just a cut above the others (many of which are also nice). We wouldn't hesitate to choose Bellagio again."
778,5.0,Absolutely amazing stay!,This was our first time staying at the Bellagio and it will 100% be the only place we stay at when visiting Vegas! We were so pleased with how clean it was! Not only was our room spotless but all areas were absolutely spotless! Thank you so much to everyone at the Bellagio that help run this place so beautifully. We saw every individual working so hard and long hours to ensure everything was perfect.
779,5.0,Wonderful stay!,People are so nice and friendly. Property is beautiful and food is amazing! We were able to check in early which was really nice due to the early morning flight we had. Highly recommend!! My new favorite place!
780,3.0,Average,"I was expecting a lot more from Bellagio. I know I'm only a Gold member, but that was never addressed at check-in (thank you for being a loyal customer). The weekend was pretty packed, but not a single upgrade was available or offered, Ather asked 5 times the host offered a penthouse for +$300 a night... No complimentary water in the room, and there should be for the gold members. Our stay did not feel luxurious at all, and we spent quite a bit of money. I know Vegas is different with the way they treat their guest, and only comps anything for gambling, I had much better experiences at the 3 other properties we stayed in the last year in Vegas."
781,2.0,Not the same Bellagio,Already mentioned prior to this page will not type again. Disappointed in what we had seen and what we were staying in. Hospitality suit should be more than what it was and what we paid for. Possible return unlikely at this point
782,5.0,Fountain View was amazing!,Went to Vegas for my birthday with some friends and the hotel to the restaurants were amazing! Close to everything! We had the fountain view suite on the 19th floor and it spectacular! Will definitely stay here without a hesitation!
783,5.0,The staff here shines--,"Our stay was 12/12 to 12/15 and we will return-We had a penthouse suite (30022) and where it was in need of a few repairs and maybe a face lift, it was clean and comfortable.The stand out here and to us the most important thing is the service provided and the staff here shines. Everyone we had contact with made us welcome and provided excellent service.One of the places we had a meal at was the Mayfair,it was more than fun and would recommended it for sure– Overall a great experience–"
784,5.0,Just me and you + BRUNO,Husband and I needed a weekend away - had a blast!!! The Bellagio didn’t disappoint.. had Bruno tickets an upgrade on the room. The room was super spacious - bed was comfy and we had a great view!!! Of course the Bellagio is located in a super place close to lots of things to see and do!!!
785,2.0,Pros and Cons - overall disappointment,"Always wanted to stay with Bellagio as it has always been a top notch 5 stars rated hotel. However for its rating and money, it has been quite a disappointing stay for our family. We first extended our stay and the second day we decided we would cancel and use the money to book a suite in another hotel. Our room is the resort king with partial fountain view. (Probably get a better room if you’re willing to pay more, but you can also get a site with some other hotels with the same price.) I have the Cons listed first since most people might not have the time to read through. Cons: 1. Dirty - I really expected more from it. The bedsheets, duvet cover, and pillow cases are greasy! I am very sensitive to smell and dust. I was sneezing my nose off through my first and second"
786,3.0,Room Upgrade,Not worth the money you pay for. I couldn’t get the room what I wanted to and I asked for. I have asked them on multiple occasions to upgrade my room but they didn’t which was very disappointing for me.
787,5.0,Bellagio is las vegas,Excelent location staff is great always helping entertainment and restaurants the best there is fun for everybody and in the middle of everything you are going to enjoy and do the things you like in a nice enviroment
788,5.0,Pleasant Room Experience stating here,"The Rooms were very nice and clean. The showers were pretty spacious. The Staywell rooms were very nice and I enjoyed the usage of the purifier. The only thing that I had an issue with is the TV remote was not too responsive to the television and it was on the blink for a couple of days but since I didn't really watch TV, it didn't really bother me."
789,3.0,disapointed,Was expecting better. Found the room to be very much like any other room in Las Vegas. There was nothing special about the room. For the price I was expecting more. I will probably not stay at this location again. Thank you
790,2.0,Mask mandate ignored.,Probably one out of five people maskless or might as well be in crowded indoor conditions. A lot of money for the privilege of exposure to COVID-19. The overpriced eateries didn't help the experience.
791,2.0,Unclean and covid disaster,The vast majority of guests and visitors in gambling areas and elevators were not wearing masks and Bellagio did nothing. Caears and Park were the opposite. If you want Covid this would be your place to get it.
792,3.0,Subpar experience,"This is not a 5 star hotel experience (despite the high price tag). There were many customer experience details that were missed from check in and throughout our stay. Check in desk had no line but the staff were behaving rushed, overwhelmed and frazzled. Our room was not ready for us at the check in time so we were left delayed waiting around for the room to get ready. We had an event to attend that evening so this was an inconvenience and issue with our being able to get to our event. We were told the Hyatt rewards points would only transfer with MLife. So were instructed to go into the casino to find the desk to get the card. No directions on how to get there. The MLife desk was not able to add the information to the hotel account when we signed up so we were instructed"
793,3.0,Not a pleasant experience,We had 4 rooms booked for a night in Bellagio and we couldn't wait for it to be over. Paid for upgrading the rooms to the fountain view but little did we knew that we will need to put up with super loud music all night. Also there was glue / sticky liquid under the cans in the mini bar. As I picked a soda can the liquid stained by brand new jacket which I reported to the house keeping and they were reluctant to do anything about it. Overall not the experience that we expected.
794,5.0,Vegas At Its Best!,This was my sons first visit to Vegas and my first stay at Bellagio. Definitely not my last. The service from all staff involved was superb. The room was among the most comfortable I’ve ever had. The location on the strip is fabulous as well.
795,5.0,21st Birthday,"Always a great time in Vegas, when in doubt go to fat tuesdays across the street and get your favorite daiquiri that will never disappoint you! Always a great time when we stay here and get to do the extractions"
796,5.0,Top quality hotel.,Stayed for 3 nights. We really enjoyed our view! Great service and stuff! We will be definitely be back. The front desk was very helpful with our needs. I would recommend the strip view. Amazing view of the fountain.
797,4.0,Family Vacation,We had problems with our rooms. Also one of the rooms the bed was not cleaned and there were what looked like blood drop stains on the pillow and bedsheets. We also were promised adjoining rooms at check in and they gave it away. They gave us adjoining rooms the next day and cleaned our sheets. Rating would have been higher if the rooms were clean. The staff at the craps table are the best and fun to play with. That is why I keep coming back to the Bellagio.
798,5.0,Las Vegas getaway!,"I had a great time at the Bellagio, hotel is right on the strip, access to everything, my room was clean, well stocked, guest services was wonderful, I checked in earlier than expected. Hotel staff very accommodating and friendly."
799,5.0,Escape The Tiredness of California State.,"Great place for visitors from all over the world . Delicious food at The Buffet at The Bellagio. The Cirque de Sole show was spectacular. Hotel suite room was spacious, comfortable, nice interior & beautiful view. Unlimited alcohol & beer for players in the casino."
800,5.0,Birtday,Fantastic birthday experience friendly entertainment was great hospitality was great I look forward to a return trip the fountain was a wonderful experience food gaming was breath taking Thank you all to make my stay wonderful
801,2.0,Not very impressive,"Had smells venting in our room from another. Smelled like Marijuana and acetone some days, room is very outdated. View was underwhelming. Probably plan to stay at the aria next time. Service is very good though from bell desk. Phones are cheap and outdated trying to call for room service."
802,3.0,"Dirty rooms, unexpected in a 5 star hotel","First room - had a dangerous crack in the shower tub ( please fix it, its sharp ) - shower head is very dirty and doesn't meet 5 star hotel quality - bath tub was dirty, seems like someone used the bath bomb before we check in After complain, room service exchanged our room and gave us $100 food/beverage voucher Second rooms - had some pink soap stain on top of the bath tub - make up mirror light is not working We were too tired to complain, so we cleaned the stain ourselves. Overall, we are not satisfied with Bellagio's room cleanliness and worried if the staffs actually take covid control seriously."
803,5.0,Best of the Strip,"The Bellagio offers the finest combination of everything you can find on the Strip. We stay there due to the consistent high level of service and room quality. There was a dip in cleanliness during the worst part of COVID, but that appears to have been resolved."
804,2.0,Room was never cleaned and my safe was broken,Not happy at all. Nobody ever contacted me to correct the situation. As well as I phoned the room services to let them know that my room was dirty from the time I checked in to the time I left it was never cleaned once.
805,4.0,"Beautiful property, dirty room","Gorgeous resort and amenities, good food, decent casino, friendly staff. Hotel room surprisingly dirty: trash on floor, 2 nightstands and a table were dirty with dried coffee splatters and dried ice cream type material?? Bathroom floor disgusting, also hairs in shower (more than just a few!). Glad we brought our own wipes! Housekeeping obviously does not care as this stuff could not be missed."
806,4.0,5 star if not for Casino Host,"You can’t go wrong with Bellagio. The atmosphere and ambience is right up our alley. Would have been better if your casino host actually communicated with us, but no not even as platinum members. Jeff Dougherty let us down. Other than that Bellagio is beautiful and that blue Ice smell is unbelievable!"
807,5.0,Great time in,I loved staying here I stayed in for a night and it was great never felt small or like I needed to get out of the room to have a good time. Staff is friendly and will help make the most out of your stay. I wish the price for items were a tad cheaper but hey that's how they get ya
808,5.0,Gorgeous and Excellent Service,"Best hotel I've stayed in on the strip so far! Mobile check-in and check-out was very convenient and easy. Bell service was quick and friendly, extra towels were delivered to our room very quickly. Highly recommend and will stay again."
809,5.0,Excellence,Great hotel. Great staff. nice amenities. Close to all the major shopping. Great view and lots of restaurants and high class shopping. The Buffet is only open till 3pm. Needs to have the dinner buffet open.
810,5.0,Great Hotel The Jewel of LV,"Bellagio is and will always be the Jewel of Las Vegas with its inside and outside attractions. The room is spacious, clean, comfortable, quite, and sanitized following the CDC guidelines. Has enough restaurants."
811,5.0,Best vacation getaway,"We stay at Bellagio every year we visit Las Vegas. They just remodeled the rooms, everything is perfect. I loved the decor. The restroom is extremely clean and beautiful. The Staff is so kind and helpful. The food at the restaurants Sadelle's and the Pattiserie is amazing!"
812,5.0,Great couples vacation,"Husband and I spent a long weekend in Vegas. We stayed in a premier wellness king suite. The room was clean, smoke free, and had a beautiful view of the mountains. We didn’t hear any noise outside of our room and got a peaceful nights sleep. The hotel is gorgeous and has many delicious places to eat. We are the patisserie and Noodles, both excellent! Staff were all friendly and helpful. It’s located across from the Paris hotel and within walking distance of many attractions. Check out was breeze, I did it using my phone. The fountain is fun to watch at night. Overall, we would stay here again and had a great time."
813,1.0,Nothing Special about this place,"I decided to spend my 50th birthday here and found that it was an expensive hotel with no character or qualities that would make you want to return. The place basically shuts down at midnight so good luck trying to get food at 2 AM. Bathrooms were also gross and I had too many kids running up and down the hall screaming at 8 AM. I never once had a good nights sleep. Save your money, go elsewhere."
814,5.0,Vacation time was excellent while I was here for my 3 days vacation . I have no complaint just elegant of atmosphere wit,I checked in with no problem the staff was great. I was here on vacation for 3 days it was pleasant. Me and my wife enjoyed the atmosphere along with food dining. Restroom were cleaned. Service was wonderful
815,1.0,Worst MGM property in Vegas,I was Extremely disappointed. Cleanliness gets a Big Zero and Service was terrible when you could get it. I will never stay at this property again. Worst MGM property in Las Vegas. To top it off one night we didn’t even have hot water … not sure how that happened.
816,4.0,"Amazing, but no free minibar.. even with penthouse","Amazing, but no free minibar.. even with penthouse. Many hotels such as Arizona Grand dont offer free mini bar's anymore. This Must change. $22 waters? Come on. Otherwise, beautiful place to stay with an excellent staff. Lily's Lounge is a great place to stop by"
817,3.0,A ONCE LUX RESORT HEADED DOWNWARD,"The resort has lost a significant amount of the high quality design and appeal since opening and when operated by Wynn. The casino floor used to be so elegant, beautiful and like no other on the strip. Now it looks just like all the others...MOSTLY those that are not ""5-star"" rated. My room in the spa tower had every lamp broken with the shade hanging on crooked and cockeyed. The bath door back and black finger print smears and blood on it. The amour lighting didn't work. Linens were sloppy placed. There were no q-tips or cotton swabs. There was mold growing around the outside shower floor. The shower door leaked significantly. I was approached by numerous hookers and prostitutes why gambling or enjoying a cocktail at the bar. SO DISGUSTING you allow these shady sorts"
818,3.0,Pricey for things I couldn't use,I paid for an early check in to be in comfort for two of my zoom meetings. Wifi was not working and the hotel supervisor was demeaning when I asked him to waive the ONE day I wasn't able to use. The representative looked at me as if I didn't belong when I was trying to get a key for my room. I had to flag a different person to get some sort of assistance. Disappointed with the judgements here.
819,5.0,Birthday weekend,From start to finish it was an awesome experience..i would do it all over again..the hotel room was spacious and the fountain view was incredible..the crew and staff was very helpful and respectful and made the experience even better..thank you again and we'll see you again..
820,3.0,Disappointed,"Awful customer service. Arrived at 8:00am checked in the night before. Checked with front desk on arrival and no rooms were available. I understand that if a room becomes available before 3:00pm they would let me know. The rest of my party arrived through the day without night before check in and received their rooms right away. I continued to check throughout the day and well after 3:00pm still no rooms. I was offered a DOWN grade twice, declined both times. I said I was going over to Ceasars and miraculously they found me a room. Second such incident this year with MGM."
821,4.0,Smoke and Mirrors,"Still a beautiful hotel. The entry to die for. The Conservatory always amusing and inventive. The Casino was well established, with every conceivable game at our beck and call. The Fountains as always takes my breath away. My room? Cavernous I'd say. A King bed, End tables, small table and chair, an odd looking breakfront filled with all the snacks you could desire at a hefty charge. A Television and a dynamite shower. Too bad hey took out the Coffee Makers."
822,3.0,Birthday Trip,"After shopping, eating, and visiting most of the strip you want to come back to the hotel room and recharge with a nice sleep. Nope! our king bed was in bad shape. The rest of Bellagio outside of the room was fine & just as expected, but part of vacation for me is relaxation so I would say my visit was just average compared to an average hotel."
823,4.0,Beautiful Rooms - terrible buffet,It was the worst Buffett I have ever been too. Usually Vegas buffets are pretty decent. The Bellagio’s buffet was not even edible. It kept me from going to the other restaurants in the casino. I expected so much more from such a beautiful place.
824,5.0,Security officer made our trip,"Overall great hotel. While trying to find the sportsbook, we ran into Security Officer Vycheth Tith who happily directed but also did the unexpected by providing us with a credit for the bar. He made our trip unforgettable and meaningful."
825,5.0,Perfect stay at Bellagio,"Loved our Fountain View Room, fountain show is mesmerizing. Mayfair After Dark was a pleasant surprise, and so much fun. Order the Cotton Candy Champagne! But prepare to get sticky ha ha Location is perfect."
826,1.0,Not a 5 star hotel,"So many minor things that just added up, from the waste basket in the bathroom not being emptied from the previous guest to glassware remaining outside the door for more than 36 hours. The resort fees are too high along with the parking - more than $60/day just in fees/parking. There are certainly better hotels and values in Vegas. I was very disappointed in this 5 star hotel."
827,5.0,beautiful bellagio,Vacations at the Bellagio are always wonderful. But the Christmas season adds a particular pleasure due to the amazing decorations in the hotel and Atrium. Its becomes a visual delight for people of all ages. Certainly worth a visit.
828,3.0,Bellagio experience continues to go downhill,The entire purpose for staying at the Bellagio has been the ability to remove yourself from a little reality and enjoy a superior experience. The Bellagio has started to become a self-service drive-through no different than any other hotel on the strip. When you start to push people to play electronic table games unless they’re willing to put $100 on the pass line you remove that experience. You can play electronic table games on your phone in your house. Same goes for slots. 500 different machines to pick from and 250 of them are buffalo. Serve yourself at the buffet started several years ago. We will still charge you a fortune for the room that has been ‘upgraded’. Pandemic or not. Have stayed here more than a dozen times over the last 5 or so years and has been my go to. This
829,5.0,Slots,In the middle of my free games my machine malfunctioned and boy was I irritated. Jean came so quickly to my machine to see what was going on. She called for help and Adan came to the rescue! Coke to find out the machine overheated and they did everything they could to see if the machine would reboot and fix the issue. Jorge the Manager came because they couldn’t fix it and they ended up accommodating me and making sure I was taken care of! Thank you folks for making me feel a little better. Our new insider is “I broke the machine” lol they deserve an award and raise for going above and beyond for not only helping me but for presenting above and beyond customer service! Outstanding I tell ya!
830,3.0,Check out was a mess,"Had wrong card on file and now have to hunt down my $200 deposit that was clearly charged to my card, even showed them the statement, but they refussed to listen and then had assured me would come back to my card."
831,5.0,Beautiful Destination,"Super friendly, professional staff. Gorgeous hotel, especially this time of year. Super clean room with fantastic view of fountains. Great assortment of restaurants and entertainment. Circ Du Soliel is highly recommended."
832,5.0,Bellagio stay 2021,"Had a wonderful stay and lots of fun looking forward in coming back, excellent services rooms and super nice and luxurious best hotel I been at so far plus the location is nice right in the middle of everything and there fountain show is amazing"
833,5.0,Christmas season at the Bellagio,The Bellagio did a fantastic job of decorating the hotel for the Christmas season. From the front desk to the main entrance room. The displays are worth seeing. The beautiful decorated Christmas tree in a winter wonderland. Ate lunch at the buffet and the food was five star. I usually don’t care for buffets but I was very impressed with this one. The Bellagio is centrally located on the strip. Also you cannot miss the waterfall show every night in front of the hotel. This time of year the water show was done to the song It’s the most wonderful time of the year.
834,5.0,Girls trip with granddaughters,We had a wonderful stay and awesome view. Jacqueline at the front desk was great. The decorations for Christmas were breathtaking. Will stay again. Such a beautiful hotel. Was a special stay for my daughter and granddaughters.
835,2.0,Overrated,"Hidden Charges, 150 per night deposit. Please factor this in on top of the daily resort fee and parking fee. There is also no little fast food court like in all the other casinos which is convenient in Vegas, only over priced restaurants."
836,5.0,Awesome Service,"First time staying here, and was not disappointed. Would highest recommend this to a colleague, service was exceptional, staff had great attitudes and were very helpful. Plan to return in a couple months."
837,5.0,Vacation,Good time to stay with family. Nice hotel! Recommended to everyone who is going to Las Vegas for their vacation. Friendly staffs all the time. Busy hotel all the time during the year even COVID-19 but people still going there a lot.
838,3.0,no hot water in shower,We were gone all afternoon after reporting it. Came back and plumber was in room. Took him another 45to an hour. He radioed housekeeping. They did not show instead a guy with dry towels- we wanted the wet towels removed from shower he said it wasn’t his job! Housekeeping let themselves in while I was asleep in the bed must later- weird!
839,5.0,3 Old Guys in Vegas,Three old friends hanging out in VEGAS. Had good food at the Buffet and the Italian restaurant (although the portions were small). Walked the property and took in the Christmas decorations. Gambled and won some money.
840,4.0,Bellagio 65th Birthday,Location is excellent and Bellagio has all the amenities. Room a little dated and stained. View of the fountain very nice. Staff helpful and responsive. Restaurant food for breakfast was excellent. Checkout a breeze.
841,5.0,Most relaxing night,"We went for a concert and we stayed in the Wellness Rooms. I had the best night sleep I have ever had at a resort. The bathroom was beyond awesome(walk in shower, dual sinks, lighted mirrors, and a lighted magnifying mirror . The decor was on point with calming color pallette. The bed sheets were so cozy and the bed was superb. It had a nice couch too. The refer was stocked with snacks, soda, alcohol if needed(for a fee). Also, there were room temperature snacks and water available(for a fee). The sheers and drapes were controlled by buttons next to the bed and door made it an ease to open and close. It HD. Nice flat screen t.v. with great quality picture. It also had one robe and two pair of slippers(for a fee) if needed. The best night ever. My husband and I really enjoyed our"
842,2.0,Chrismas Vegas get away,"over all trip was nice, but the room was not worth the price. it will not book at bellagio again. The room is spaces, bit very limit amenities. No refri, no coffee machine, jacuzzi was not work and ac was super noisy."
843,3.0,I'm not going to retype. Numerous issues.,"This is no longer a 5 star experience, definitely a 5 star bill. Issues with most areas of the hotel. Not kid friendly. Went for a wedding, requested rooms near one another. We got 3 in spa tower, same floor. Other was in short tower. Quite a hike. No coffee on Spa side till 6am. Way overpriced and over-rated."
844,5.0,Very good,"Over all it was a very good experience. The check in was quick because of their hotel App. The room was very clean, nice, food was great, room was clean while I was in the casino every day. Other than loud guesses staying up to all hours it was a great time."
845,2.0,Everything is expensive,(Go to CVS to buy water or drinks) . 8.00 for small bottle of water is horrible. Ramen soup at noodles was 17.00 and was just Ramen soup. Food at the snack bar was horrible pizza combo was 19.00 and the best part about that “meal” was the garlic knots. The staff is incredibly unfriendly and if you have a disability (I can not hear) the staff acts like your a total inconvenience.
846,3.0,Electronic phone key - horrible failure,The room/elevator keys worked about 25% of the time. Most guests were complaining about this issue during our stay. Also many dining options were closed or with limited hours. The hotel is starting to show its age.
847,4.0,PLEASE ADD COFFEE/HOT WATER MAKER TO ROOMS,"This hotel is beautiful! Now, I get it that they want you to spend money in restaurants and casinos, but come on, a Suite with NO coffee/hot water maker?? In fairness, I did not contact hotel to see if could get one sent to room, so do not know if that was an option."
848,5.0,Best on the strip,One of the best ones on the strip. We got the room with the view and it was the Cherry on the top. We used the Amex for the stay and got the free brunch and room upgrades + $100 on the spa. The tram helped with the travel on the strip with the kids.
849,3.0,Reservations cancelled,I booked through my Hyatt app and received all my confirmation emails. Even received it days before my travel date. However when we got to desk to check in I was told that all of our reservations were cancelled. The lady at the front desk told us the Hyatt cancelled them but then proceeded to tell the Hyatt rep that they cancelled them and hour later that finally rebooked our rooms.
850,5.0,A great winter getaway,I had a fantastic time at Bellagio in December. The staff is personable and professional. I like the location and I am looking forward to returning. This is a great place to stay for anyone who wants entertainment and fun.
851,5.0,My stay at Bellagio,"I stayed at the hotel four times in 2021. I stayed in a suite each time. The suite was very well furnished and the Covid protocols were excellent and unlocked some hotels the room was cleaned and serviced each day. The restaurants are first class and we are six different ones. We had breakfast each morning at Sadels and they had great service,food and a excellent menu. The hotel is well decorated and has a variety of shops and convenience stores in the hotel. The SPA is wonderful"
852,5.0,Convenient,Love the hotel and location. Very convenient to other hotels and great staff. Love the bathroom. Very roomy The bad thing is they charge $18 a day for parking for guests. I think it should be free if you’re a guest.
853,5.0,Bellagio is as good as ever,"We have been going to the bellagio from the first month it opened as a Steve Wynn hotel. In addition to business meetings I’ve conducted, it’s been a family getaway for vacations every year. We love the rooms, the location on the strip, the restaurants are great and diverse enough so we rarely leave the resort. The suites have a steam option which makes the experience of taking a shower incredible. We will never switch hotels!"
854,5.0,High suggest stay here,It was a very wonderful experience here. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was excellent and loved the views. Definitely recommend and we will be back to stay again. Thank you for the great experience and can’t wait to come back soon.
855,5.0,Great Vegas Trip,"We came out for a couple trip and the Golden Knights/Flyers game. The stay at the Bellagio was incredible. The staff was very nice and on top of everything we needed. The hotel and casino was first class all the way,"
856,5.0,Blessed xmas,It was like being in Disneyland blissful enjoyable a dream come true great service wonderful food great surroundings beautiful holiday display wonderful shopping avenue great view from room delightful soa
857,5.0,Amazing Vacation,there were a lot of interesting slot machines to choose from and the floor is very safe. there are also a good choice of table games with very helpful and amiable dealers. There is also ample cocktail service at the tables. Room service is also available with a pretty good selection of dishes. The fountain view from the room was fantastic.
858,5.0,"exceptional,","beautiful, one thing I did not like is the smoking, i could smell it walking in the hallways. in the casino I could not breathe the smoke was terrible, love the place will come back, but please.....make it smoke free."
859,4.0,Couples Retreat,"Friendly staff . Bellhop and Check in service very accommodating . Top notch restaurants, entertainment , and spa. Great location and easy access to the strip. The room had a spectacular view of the fountains and the Paris balloon."
860,3.0,Was Hoping for More,"I have been to Vegas a handful of times and I always looked at the Bellagio as this very opulent, very regal place. I was disappointed. It took you a small expeditionary trek to walk anywhere. We went to the wrong tower the first time as it was not stated anywhere which tower we were staying. Food is outragiously priced and par at best. Just was hoping for more."
861,3.0,Penthouse Suite not up to par..,"Splurged on penthouse suite for my 50th birthday. Extremely disappointed. Expected superior service, received better service at a Days Inn. Room was spacious and had an amazing view of the mountains, but dated. For issues we had, communication was non existent, unless I wanted to sit in the room on the phone, not what I wanted to do in Vegas.. The best service was from bell staff, they are amazing."
862,3.0,Not worth the money,"Bellagio is beautiful, the room is nice. Everything is way overpriced. The buffet is not open for dinner. The “nicer” restaurants tell you there is a dress code and you think you are getting dressed up for a real nice dinner however the dress code is not enforced, it is so loud you can’t converse. The food is overpriced and you leave hungry unless you decide to spend your life savings on one meal. The shower in the rooms looks beautiful but the water pressure is poor and you can’t control the temp worth a darn. The mini bar is well stocked but again costs a fortune, 12$ For a small bottle of water, 18$ for the larger one. Overall it is not worth the money!!"
863,5.0,Fabulous experience.,"I went for a Business and Personal experience and stayed in a ""Wellness Suite"" -- It rejuvenated me! Unbelievably comfortable and relaxing. Great location, food was fabulous & casino was fun. Best staff ever!"
864,5.0,A Time in Heaven,"Our two-night stay was perfect from arrival to check-in, the cozy accommodation, sleep-enducing comfortable bed, soothing shower, excellent service at every point, beautiful flower displays, delicious meals, all the way through check-out."
865,5.0,Turkey Day,"I chose Bellagio for Thanksgiving weekend and they came through with flying colors as usual. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful and always cheerful. The cleanliness and the comfort of the room met 5 star standards. As Arnold said, “ i’ll be back“."
866,5.0,I like it,I like this place because it's nice and clean employees are friendly most of all my rooms are comp. I will come back with my friends and family . Oh I forgot that I love your buffets and the shows that outside the casino.
867,4.0,Get away,"All was very nice. Enjoyed the seasonal decorations. Just cannot believe they charge guest to park. If guest must pay, lower the cost, and have a designated parking area for them. Why do they have to be mixed in with public parking."
868,4.0,Though it’s getting outdated,"Wish there’s a refrigerator instead of the bar but the bed and pillows are good. We all enjoyed amour stay. One of our favorite hotels in Las Vegas. Very relaxing, specially when you get the fountain view."
869,5.0,Love This Place,"Every single person we encountered at the Bellagio was friendly, courteous, and helpful. The property is beautiful- second to none. If you can swing it, staying in a fountain view room is awesome. We’ve stayed here a few times and can’t seem to be able to stay anywhere else. Location is good for walking along the strip and convenient to so much in Vegas."
870,5.0,Vegas getaway,"First time staying at the Bellagio. Very nice hotel and casino. Plenty of casino games. Great location on the Vegas strip. The conservatory is always beautiful, especially during the holidays. Close to the free Aria tram that takes you to the Park MGM hotel."
871,5.0,My Bellagio Stay,I would highly recommend staying at the Bellagio! The staff were amazing and all so kind. The place was very clean. This was my very first time in Vegas as well as staying at the Bellagio and will NOT be my last.
872,5.0,Excellent views and location,"I has the fountain view room. The view was excellent! Private viewing of the fountain day and night. The window looked like a painting overlooking Paris and the Eiffel Tower structure across the street. Location is central with quick access to numerous other hotels and venues. The only downside is the congestion around the lobby area. Otherwise, excellent stay!"
873,4.0,Very Enjoyable stay,"Bellagio was equal to itself with very clean facility, enjoyable personnel and undoubtable efficiency overall Thanks to maintain this high level with years. Most especially the restaurant personnel were able to create a home feeling Bernard Montreal, Qc"
874,5.0,Perfect stay!,Incredible time at an amazing resort. The food alone sets Bellagio apart add in the service which across the board from check in to the casino floor will make you and yours feel like royalty. I can’t recommend enough.
875,5.0,"Gorgeous hotel, casino and decorated beautifully for Christmas.","Beautifully decorated for Christmas, elegant, huge. Pricey, but you can see why. Staff was professional, very friendly, listened. Room was super clean, overlooking the strip, just as we requested. Food was very good, but super pricey. Shops were amazing."
876,5.0,Fountain View,"Everything at the Bellagio is elegant, classy, and spectacular. I especially love the different scenes they put in the winter garden area, and of course the fountains out front. Room service is superb and it sometimes beats going out to eat because you have the peace of your own room and a fabulous meal!"
877,5.0,Amazing place to stay!,"We love the Bellagio, great staff, clean hotel, my favorite part was the botanical gardens at night and the fancy chinese restaurant with a great view of the fountains. The only thing I didn’t care for was it can be tricky to find common things in a hotel, like a place to buy cheap snacks, drinks, etc. or even a bathroom the place is so huge."
878,5.0,Clean rooms,"Love the rooms, it was ery comfortable, especially the bed, very comfy and neat, had enjoy our view and the casino are clean too, I definitely recommend to my family and friends me, my family and friends had fantastic stay"
879,5.0,Excellent experience,"The service never fails, rooms are amazing and quality of ALL things are outstanding. Loved the Christmas display! Restaurants all had great service and great food. Only opportunity feedback is to increase staff at the Mlife counter. There was a line no matter what time of day."
880,4.0,Smoking,It’s the most beautiful and iconic hotel with the best location. We loved our fountain view room. Too bad the cigarette smell in the room was so overwhelming to us nonsmokers. But the staff and the amenities were wonderful.
881,5.0,"Great place for shops, restaurants, and stay.",The location of this place was amazing. Everything was close by. The restaurants and shops at this hotel were also fantastic. The room was decent size and clean. The pastry shop own by Bellagio was a must try. Highly recommend!
882,5.0,Get Away Wknd,"My best friend, and I had a fantastic ""Get Away"" wknd at the ""Bellagio""!! The hotel is ""Simply Beautiful, and the Staff was very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. The room was spacious, cilean; and the window view was wonderful. The beds, pillows, and towels smelled nice and fresh. The ""Bellagio"" is definently a 5 Star Hotel, and we will be back soon!!"
883,5.0,Graduation trip,It was a pleasure staying at this hotel. I appreciate that all staff had there mask on and there was mask and hand sanitizer available for the guest. The room view was amazing. The only down for me was that the shower door did not close all in and the floor was wet. But besides that it was amazing. I would stay again.
884,5.0,Vegas First Timer,"I expected all the glamour and excitement of VEGAS and the BELLAGIO delivered !00%! From first impressions to last, our stay was perfect. Fun, Modern games and those GREAT retro slots we love were literally intermingled everywhere on the casino floor and let me tell you IT WAS a great night in the CASINO! The well-appointed room as well as the view were absolutely stunning! PAMPERED and RELAXED are the words that come to mind. We have already booked our return trip for 2022 and now just to decide which of the great restaurants to try this time!"
885,4.0,"Nice hotel,","Beautiful hotel, very clean. Spa is amazing. Service is great. Smoking and pets were allowed in the pool area, which was under construction. Jack hammer noise and lots of dust. But that type of work has to get done some time, so NOV makes sense when it is still good weather and smaller crowds. Great stay. Will definitely stay here again."
886,5.0,Luxury and Safety and Fun...all in one place,hadn't been to LV for a few years. Bellagio is still one of the best properties and they were very good at keeping the safety protocols in place in the hotel areas. The casino areas were more of a mixed bag of masks/no masks..but lots of room between the tables...pool areas were lovely and had great service.
887,5.0,"Is this heaven? No, but it is the Bellagio!","It just has a great feel, from the time you arrive to the time you depart. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is very well trained and good at their jobs. M-life perks are wonderful. The Holiday Gift Shopping event was outstanding. First class all the way."
888,5.0,Always Awesome,Bellagio is just an overall great experience. It would be nice if the craps tables were not so expensive. The quality of the rooms is very nice. I like the various restaurants and lounges. The oiano bar is a great touch.
889,5.0,Awesome as always,"Beautiful rooms, excellent restaurants, wonderful staff, clean and an awesome place to stay when you are in Las Vegas. The casino is wonderful with so many machines and tables it is difficult to decide where to play."
890,5.0,Loved it,Loved the atmosphere of the hotel and all the restaurants we dined at were incredible! The tables were clean and made you feel safe walking around. We usually stay at Aria or Delano but I will definitely be staying at Bellagio again.
891,5.0,Completely Satisfied.,We found the entire experience to be excellent. The room was clean and ready and room service to clean the room was non invasive and the restaurants and all staff were top notch. I will be back for sure.
892,5.0,Excellent Service!,Bellago Hotel & Casino is beautiful. Staff is very friendly & courteous. I love the restaurants and the lovely fountain!! I felt safe throughout my stay. Great COVID-19 safety protocols. Thank You for a wonderful Las Vegas getaway!!!
893,3.0,Too expensive for what you get.,I was at the hotel for a business conference. The check in was slow due to not enough people at the front desk. My bathroom door handle was ready to fall off. Restruant prices are very expensive. Everything on the menu is a la carte so the price goes up quickly. The hotel was beautiful inside a decked out for Christmas.
894,5.0,Great plane to stay,"I stayed for the first time at the Bellagio in December 2021. The staff exceeded all my expectations. And when I say staff, I mean everyone of them. The server. At the Bellagio buffet, the housekeeping staff, security and the front desk personnel. Everyone made my trip great."
895,5.0,The Special Bellagio,Stayed at Bellagio to celebrate my 60th. The reason I stay there is that it is like an oasis in the middle of the desert. Staff are always helpful. You can go there and relax in the middle of all the madness.
896,4.0,Swanky rooms but no coffee maker,"The rooms are swanky but what resort doesn't have a coffee maker in a premium suite? Having to go downstairs to wait in line to get coffee is less than ideal. Plus the room fridge is one of those pre-filled with snacks and drinks for outrageous prices, so you can't put any of your own stuff in it! Lastly the pillowsb are too floppy!"
897,5.0,Excellent service,I stay at Bellagio four times in month and a half and always had Great time and I enjoyed myself being at the Bellagio. Thank you for everything and I’m looking forward to stay there again Probably in a few weeks
898,5.0,Birthday Party Success,"This was my second time to host my birthday party (11 people in total, all adults, coed) at the Bellagio. The staff were amazing and easy to work with. The pastry chef made a beautiful cake (I just said, defer to pastry chef and gave the color and flavor of the cake I wanted). Dinner at the Mayfair was AMAZING! Food, waitstaff and entertainment excellent."
899,5.0,Top Notch resort,The Bellagio is a beautiful resort. The decor is exquisite and the service is outstanding. Rooms are beautiful and comfortable. And the conservatory is AMAZING. It is decorated each season with the most beautiful displays you can imagine. No other hotel has topped it! I absolutely LOVE staying there.
900,5.0,Amazing!,The real uppercrust of the strip...absolutely beautiful and the staff went above and beyond. Everyone at every level was so professional but also friendly and helpful. The entire Casino and restaurant sections were fantastic. Best restaurants ever!
901,5.0,Class Act All the Way!,"The staff are wonderful at the Bellagio. Cocktail staff are more plentiful here than any other casino I have frequented lately. The rooms are beautiful, the beds soft and comfy, and the pillows are fabulous. The casino hosts are first-rate all the way and will help you in any way possible."
902,5.0,Amazing Stay!,The Belligio staff and resort was amazing for our family vacation. They do not miss any detail from check in to check out. What ever we needed from questions to services the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
903,5.0,Stay at Bellagio.,"It was a wonderful bonding time with my sisters; great venue (love the conservatory as always), excellent food at the Lagos and the view of the fountain, and superb accommodations (spa, housekeeping, front desk)."
904,5.0,Beautiful Hotel With Great Customer Service,"The magic of the Bellagio at Christmas time starts the minute you walk through the front entrance. You can hear, see and smell the wonder of the season. I just love this hotel at Christmas. And the magic doesn’t stop there. I was greeting with a warm smile by Gordon at the front desk. He was wonderful and when I told him this was my birthday trip, he brought out a red rose and some chocolates for me. His kindness definitely set the pace for a wonderful stay. My friend and I stayed on the 26th floor facing the city and mountains. It was an incredible renovated room. Very quiet, with comfort all around. The beds were amazing and we both slept well every night. So many complements I want to bestow on the Bellagio…but you’ll just have to go there yourself. But if you can’t stay"
905,5.0,Very Nice Hotel,This was a great place to stay. Room has a bathtub and a shower. Mini bar was a bit expensive. Parking was very easy. No hassle at all. Getting to room from the parking garage was also no hassle. Very comfortable
906,5.0,Great place,Christmas decorations were absolutely beautiful! Superb restaurants and lounges. Attentive servers in casino. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great location and convenient to other places on the strip. Will return
907,3.0,Problems with theft and noise at night,Leather gloves were stolen from the pocket of a packed coat in the room. Our room faced the fountains but the unbelievable volume of music from across the street at Drai's Beachclub and Nightclub between 12:30 am- 3 am each night caused many hours of lost sleep.
908,5.0,There is no place like the Bellagio!,"There is no place like the Bellagio. It's fountains obvi, the gardens, the art, the marble, the architecture, the food is all first class! The staff still know how to take care of the customer with the little things."
909,1.0,Bad customer service,Bad customer service for some reason the room my book was only one bed and I need it two beds and they did not change it for me I explain to them that I have my kids with me and they didn’t care they said they couldn’t give me a wheel in bed but you know how those are my son is 16 years old measures 6’5 he did not Fit on that thing he slept so uncomfortable
910,3.0,Not great as expected.,Had a great fountain view and the room was very clean but had a problem with the noise from the JBL speakers in the room all night. Couldn't sleep at all. When complained at the front desk nobody reacted as expected. The service provided by the restaurant staff was also not great. Overall had a bad experience
911,5.0,THE FANTASTIC BELLAGIO,"My wife and I decided to stay at the Bellagio for the time on our 34th anniversary. We’re stayed at other hotels in Vegas but nothing as GRAND as the BELLAGIO. The service was impeccable. From the concierge’s to housekeeping all the service staff were very well trained in customer services. The hotel had everything you could want casino, food, shops, even a tram to let you experience other casinos. I had to beg my wife to leave Bellagio and our wonderful room to see more of Vegas. What a wonderful anniversary experience at THE FANTASTIC BELLAGIO!"
912,5.0,The only way to go 👍,One of the best places to stay if not the best…A beautiful hotel and casino. I’ve stayed at several places in Vegas and I believe this is one of the most luxurious. They treat you like a king or queen. The swimming pool area is unbelievable. It is just a very outstanding hotel and casino. You have to go there and see what I am talking about.
913,5.0,Birthday,Everything thing about the Bellagio was up and above our expectations. All associates were helpful and kind .food was outstanding the cleanliness was fantastic 👏 and the view of the fountains from our room was amazing
914,5.0,Much better this time,The 1st time I stayed at this hotel the room was disappointing. This was suppose to be one of the best places to stay. I voiced my concerns and was invited back to stay in an upgraded room. I was not disappointed this time.
915,5.0,A Must Resort in Vegas,"If you're considering a trip to Vegas, the Bellagio is the place to stay. Book your room on the ""Stay Well"" floor (23rd & 24th floors) and if possible and if available with the Fountain View. It will be an experience like no other in Vegas."
916,5.0,sincitysfinest,excellent stay enjoyed our time. would recommend it to friends and family and anyone else who was thinking about staying at the Bellagio. most likely to come back soon for each of the seasonal displays and art that you display which we enjoy the most.
917,3.0,Could be better,"Poor customer service and communication when booking/using spa/salon and restaurants however, the rooms are very lovely, and the valet parking staff is excellent. Room service is also great with very little wait time."
918,5.0,The Bellagio is always a premium experience...,"We stay, we gamble, we love the central location on the Strip with easy walk down even as far as NYNY or up to TI/Wynn. The fountains are an absolute fav every time, Shania right across the street at PH is awesome... we do Vegas 2-3x every year, Bellagio frequently and MGM always!"
919,5.0,Great Property,"My room was clean. Great nights sleep. Would suggest to bring back coffee in the rooms. I did not order room service, so I cannot comment on that. Staff was awesome! The guys in valet for luggage and taxi service were awesome! Had a great time. Flew in for one night to see Ronnie Milsap at The Golden Nugget."
920,3.0,Close your eyes for better view,Upon check in was told room was not avaialble and would put us in another lakeview room. Room they put is in had a rooftop view of ac units. Only thing said they could do was give was food and dine cr.
921,4.0,1st time,"First time to stay a Bellagio. Awesome hotel. Middle of strip. Table are a bit pricey, but early morning and mid-day tables are affordable. Clean. Sports betting is a great place to sit and veg if want to watch."
922,3.0,Booming bass noise from Cosmopolitan nightclub in spa tower,"Spa tower was otherwise great and met our expectations, but Saturday night around 11pm a booming irregular bass from (according to guest services) started up until into the early morning. Ridiculously loud. You should think about staying elsewhere until they do something about it."
923,4.0,40th Birthday Celebration.,"The casino is great and the staff was even better. Our only minor complaint would be the room. The bathroom was struggling with some old plumbing. Besides that minor issue, everything else was amazing."
924,4.0,Great place to stay,"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very nice. Make sure you put a reservation in to ANY restaurant, even the buffet, because otherwise you have a very long wait hour and a half plus. That was the only disappointing thing and that’s trivial."
925,5.0,Great way to spend Thanksgiving!,"We had a great 5-night stay over Thanksgiving. The Mayfair Supper Club put on quite a show for Thanksgiving and the other restaurants offered excellent meals the other nights. The casino was clean, rooms comfortable and staff very friendly."
926,5.0,Best Hotel in Las Vegas,"This was one of the best hotels we have ever experienced and right on the Las Vegas strip. We had a room with the entire view of the strip and what joy waking up every morning to the see this as well as a full view of the water fountains that have a show every 15 minutes at 7pm. They do have specific polices that you need to know before you check in the room so you are charged for items you thought might be included. They have so many beautiful restaurants, fantastic entertainment and plenty of places to gamble and drink the night away without even leaving the hotel property. We can’t wait to come back next year!"
927,5.0,"Calling all , FOODIES read here","PERFECT- I’m very very picky about hotels , sheets housekeeping, food all should be done well and theses people do it perfect! Best advice - make dinner reservations ahead !! Just call the concierge and they will help you ! If you are a super foodie ( like me) They do not disappoint- And you should also know their main big restaurants in this hotel are fabulous but pricy , we spent about 100. Per Person but consider it the highlight of the trip , yes they are THAT good - However they have smaller alternatives that are cheaper, with good sandwiches you can grab and go - We ate at PRIME ( steak and seafood ) and LAGO ( Italian and seafood) both EXCELLENT I love food and fine dining so this hotel was a good choice for us - This hotel is connected via walkway to Caesars"
928,4.0,I still love Vegas,Overall the trip was very good. The rooms are not cheap and we did have an issue with the TV in the shower. The maintenance crew was very helpful and fixed these issues immediately. However the shower continued to leak throughout the whole trip. The cost of the water inside the room and the drinks are absurd but you’re not forced to drink or eat them so I guess that’s on us. Would be very helpful if those items were priced reasonably considering how much they’re already making for the room itself.
929,3.0,Not worth the money,"Room was okay, not worth the money. Tables are not open til 12:30. And all had $25 limit and up. Dealers were great and helpful. Not the best service in some Restaurants. Will stay somewhere else next time"
930,5.0,Boyfriend's Birthday Weekend,This is our second time staying here with comp rooms through the Myvegas app and it is by far our favorite place to stay in Vegas. We weren't able to upgrade this time because it was Thanksgiving weekend but the room was still lovely and the bathroom was awesome. The casino/lobby and restaurants/shops are luxurious and just beautiful to see. We will definitely be back! The staff is friendly and helpful right down to the room service workers. Can't wait to go back.
931,5.0,Best Stay Ever in Vegas,"Bellagio remodel is wonderful and conservatory is spectacular. Comfortable beds, upgraded bright lighting, all new designs and colors, large showers. Carpet was new and nice, so were linens. Loved the electronic curtains."
932,5.0,Nice,"Everything about the trip was awesome. The decorations for the holidays were great. The pool area was super, especially for December. The bed was super comfy. I couldn’t ask for a greater spot for us for the weekend."
933,5.0,best place to stay,"I always stay at the Bellagio. I have stayed at all the hotels in and around Vegas and for the last 8 years have settled on the Bellagio. It is consistently clean, comfortable, fun, entertaining, great food and wonderful staff"
934,4.0,NFR Stay,"Recent stay for NFR, always a great experience at the Bellagio. BET MGM team helpful, Holiday decorations are always exquisite, as well as the restaurants and gaming areas. Will return to the Hotel on an upcoming visit."
935,4.0,Good service,I enjoy my stay and good food and service and clean rokms and nice viwe .iwill re omned this hotle to my friends and famliy and was good rssturant and shows i will go ba k agian to this hotel .this wax my first visit there
936,2.0,Disaster from the start,"They are not ready for full operations yet. Guaranteed early check in on the website does not mean that when you get there. Brought wrong luggage to my room. Housekeeping missed a day. Couples massage at the spa was interesting. Brought me out to another women, not my wife. Wifes massage therapist fell asleep multiple times during."
937,2.0,Horrendous customer service attitude,"Booked 2 months in advance, paying full price for a suite boasting lakeside view of the fountain show. Got to the suite and was on 4th floor with a view of the casino roof top; impossible to see the fountains/lake. Called the desk and was rudely told “you pay for the room, not the view”. This is second AND last time we will book this property. Previously booked a suite for a big anniversary and our room was in the back looking over the garbage pick up area."
938,4.0,"Great view, dirty bathroom","The woman who checked us in was amazing. Kind, caring, and we love the room she picked for us. I believe her name was Rosaly. However, the bathroom cleaning was lacking. There was hair on the wall of the shower and in the tub, and when I filled the tub for a bath there was a lot of dirt and debris floating in the water. I had to drain it, wipe it down, and fill again. Upon checkout I wasn't even asked how my stay had been, I volunteered the issues with the bathroom and was simply told that there had been plumbing problems and many guests have been complaining about it. Hair on the wall of the shower and side of the tub is not a plumbing issue, and even many guests were complaining then shouldn't something be done to correct the issue? I was extremely disappointed in the fact"
939,5.0,Overall experience.,"We had a wonderful vacation. The room, food and hotel experience was superior. The lobby and atrium exceeded our expectations. The fountain display and music that was piped into our room as spectacular! Also, Prime Steakhouse exceeded our expectations!"
940,4.0,Fancy hotel,Beautiful architecture and nice Holiday decorations. Rooms are very nice. The only thing I didn't like was the shower. It is one of the walk in showers with glass walls and no doors. It gets very cold inside while showering. Also no coffee maker in the room was surprising.
941,5.0,Great time,"Very impressed with how clean it was and how friendly the staff was. Didn’t hurt we won two jackpots, either. Seamless check in and out, NO LINES. Digital room keys may need some work. Ours didn’t work and I noticed a few other guests having problems"
942,5.0,Wonderful,"This hotel was amazing. Great views, staff, casino, food. Everything was awesome. I will definitely stay here again. From the greeting in to checking bags was amazing. The rooms look EXACTLY like the pictures. Everything is BEAUTIFUL!!!"
943,1.0,DO NOT BOOK USING LOWEST RATES,If you use Hyatt or MGM award points do not book the Bellagio. They have a special tower for non full rate paying sinners like you. It's called the spa tower. It's old rooms but that can be ok many hotels have older rooms but with TLC that's fine. What is not fine is:- Showers that leak Wine from the fridge that is corked A toilet system that flushes with decibels equal to a large truck A digital key system that is unreliable. Even if the line for check in is long find a way to get a plastic key. Otherwise you will find yourself traveling up and down in the elevator frantically trying to get a green light and push your floor. Assuming you pass that test the next one is trying to open the door to your room. A hint ... It requires team work. We tried to help a lady in the
944,3.0,Disappointed,Disappointing Shower was broken not water pressure. Room carpet not cleaned I have stayed here many times it was never this bad. You would not expect that from this hotel Great building nice people but this visit wasn’t close to price and what your expectations are
945,2.0,Everything that is wrong with Corporate Las Vegas in one big package,"First the good - asked for and got a quiet room location. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and quiet. Staff was great - especially David at the Sports Bar and the wonderful woman who cleaned room 9103. Overall Covid precautions were great. Now the rest - we arrived around 6:30 pm after a long travel day and time change. After check in we wanted something to eat and a cocktails. The concierge was done at 6 (couldn't afford to hire one for a few more hours?) and the only map available was the one you could download on your phone which was useless. Corporate has deliberately designed the huge casino floor as a maze under the theory that if you are forced to wander the urge to gamble will overwhelm you and you will spend more money. We looked hard for what we wanted - it was"
946,4.0,business trip,"I traveled on business, was disappointed my room wasn't ready and I was forced to pay for an upgrade. so much for all the free upgrades you hear about in Vegas, so I paid an extra 40/night for an upgraded room and they didn't even provide a robe."
947,4.0,Worth the stay at Bellagio?,"Always a great location on the strip, beautiful casino, friendly staff. But trying to find a place to have dinner was hopeless! The coffee shop was closed as well as their dinner buffet, good thing we could walk to other casinos to feed ourselves!"
948,5.0,I love it!,My Birthday Celebration for the past 8 years with the exception of Covid-19 has been always simply amazing!!!! The Bellagio is the only hotel that I have stayed at since my Vegas annual birthday celebrations started. I would love to have the exact Bellagio mattresses in my home.
949,5.0,Another great visit to Bellagio,"My family celebrated being able to visit together from all parts of the Country for the first time in 2 years. We chose Bellagio as our 4 day home base for several reasons and they did not disappoint. Bellagio is a beautiful venue. We enjoyed fun gambling, the dealers at the tables we played were all great representatives for Bellagio. The restaurants are incredible, ate breakfast at Sadelles several days and dinner at Yellowtail twice. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The Concierge staff helped us with reservations. Check in/out was quick and easy. We'll be returning there a couple more times in 2022!"
950,4.0,Beautiful Hotel,"A beautiful hotel, and we really enjoyed our stay. Lots to see and do. The fountains are not to be missed and the conservatory decorated for Christmas was outstanding. We are only giving it 4 stars because our room was not cleaned at all one of the days we were there."
951,5.0,Bellagio stay,We always enjoy our stay at the Bellagio. The rooms are well kept. The casino has a variety of games. The hotel is in the center of the strip for easy access to other venues. The tram is free transportation to the Aria and the Park MGM.
952,1.0,Know going in.,"Having visited Vegas many times including this property I thought I knew the basics. Well they have changed. Don’t expect anything from them for playing. What you get offered to show up is it. So have fun and know this going in, don’t try to play where you are staying. It does not matter to them."
953,5.0,the best there is now what?,everything at the belaggio was first class suite the food casino the limo to and from airport the pool area Palio's and the gelato top shelf.the suite was roomy with whirlpool in tub huge bed lots of drawers roomy closet with bathrobe
954,2.0,"Beautiful building, horrible room view, overcrowded.",My first visit at the Bellagio and after paying for a room upgrade at the time of processing the reservation process and qualifying for an AMEX room upgrade. Our standard king room overlooked the parking lot.
955,5.0,Bellagio is class.,Staff were especially impressive. Patient and professional with huge crowds checking in and out. The concierge got us show tickets after Ticketmaster said it was sold out. Sandelles is a wonderful breakfast spot. On-line reservations are simple and save you a 10-15 minute wait in line. Bellagio remains our #1 Vegas hotel.
956,5.0,Always impressive,"Bellagio always beautiful, friendly and impressive all around. Excellent location and staff ready to help in any way they can. Value for beauty, location and level of service is all worth it. I will be back!"
957,5.0,Fantastic Hotel,Always a great time and exceptional service. Our number one choice when staying in Las Vegas. Great location. The cleanest rooms and the best customer service. Prime Steak House and Lago never disappoint.
958,5.0,One of the very best hotels in las vegas ever,"The stay, decor , and customer service was amazing. Such a great feel the place it was hard to ever want to leave. If you plan a trip to vegas consider the bellagio as it lives up to it reputation of 5 stars"
959,5.0,Beautiful for Couples,"Great for couples! Would consider others for families with children/teenagers. Definitely great for anniversaries, proposals etc. Quite a walk if looking for a variety of more affordable eateries. Would stay again for my anniversary."

962,4.0,Nice Stay,"Had a nice stay while attending a Conference, just the wrong time, it was in November, right before Thanksgiving and while it started getting cold, I could not enjoy the Pool nor the Winter Wonderland exhibit, but over all it was a great experience, very good location, very clean Hotel and rooms, many restaurants to chose from, large Casino floor and most importantly friendly Staff."
963,5.0,Excellent hotel,It was a fun trip. great fitness center and the staff was wonderful from the front desk to the ones in the restaurants. You must go to Mayfair Super Club as it is a wonderful dinner and show for all that visit.
964,5.0,Best trip ever,"Everything was perfect from check-in, rooms, food, casino, entertainment… it was all just amazing. It was our first time out to Las Vegas and I would not want to stay anywhere else on the strip. Not that we didn’t want to leave the hotel, but we didn’t have to if we didn’t want to."
965,5.0,My Favorite LV Place,The Bellagio is my favorite location in LV. I love the rooms and how well maintained the place is. I come with friends and we thoroughly enjoy your selection of restaurants. We have been to Cirque de Soleil there and will see it again. We also shop in your stores.
966,5.0,The Best!!,We really enjoyed our stay. Excellent room and service. Location was perfect with a view of the fountain and the strip. I would recommend this hotel to all. It is also kid-friendly. I will definitely be back for another visit.
967,4.0,Improved service and good stay,After 90 stays since 1999 I’ve seen lots of ups and downs. On this trip the check in went great and finally got the upgraded lake view room. Overall service was better than my two previous trips in 2021
968,5.0,Perfect hotel for first visit!,"This was my first trip to Vegas and I thought the Bellagio was the perfect place to stay. Great location, great casino, awesome views from the room! All staff was helpful and kind, and we were so excited to see the conservatory was decorated for Christmas. We’ll definitely be back!"
969,5.0,Room was clean and service was good.,I saw mixed reviews about the rooms so I was worried that it might not be a good stay. I was happy to see that the room we stayed in was clean. We normally stay at a newer hotel that costs more but this was worth the lower cost so we would consider this as an option for future visits.
970,5.0,Vegas,"We came for a medical conference and the accommodations were on par. Parking was easy, check in with the phone and having the door key and notifications was awesome. The room and the view and the bathroom were extraordinary."
971,5.0,Outstanding Guest Relations,This was my first time staying at Bellagio and the staff went out of their way to make it memorable. On arrival my room had an awful odor and it was immediately resolved. Maya of Guest relations went out of her way to resolve the issue
972,5.0,11-4-2021 trip,"We were there for 4 nights just recently, the accommodations were very nice, the food good, but the tables were too expensive . $50-100.00 per bet is just too high, we are hoping your management will re-evaluate this decision."

976,5.0,Bellagio is the best,Why do I like staying at the Bellagio 1. First class service 2. Good good 3. Comfortable room 4. Love the swimming pools 5. The Sports Bar 6. Good shopping close by 7. In the middle where I want to go. Aria to Caesar’s. Everything walking distance or a tram away
977,5.0,"Great property, great visit!","We enjoyed our visit to Bellagio, the room was great and the service and value were outstanding. We’ll definitely be back! We attended several shows and enjoyed our stay. Not too sure why this review has to be so long, this is an inconvenience!!!"
978,5.0,Great experience,"Bellagio was aces. Games are well run, rooms new and clean, food was awesome and our host took great care of us. Highlight was a celebration in the Lily nightclub with champagne selected by our server and great service all the way to our final minute!"
979,5.0,Fantastic staff,We booked through American Express. We were fortunate enough to receive a room upgrade. Your staff was tremendously accommodating. The fountain view room did not disappoint!! The food selection at the Buffet was great.
980,5.0,Thanksgiving weekend,"My family checked in noon time on the 24th November, with me. Upon arrival it was very quick we were given our rooms and we were on our way to the rooms. We kept our bags and went down to the casino area. I have been to this hotel many many times and found that it was the same atmosphere like before the Covid came in. We had our dinner here, and the food was as excellent as before. They had added many new gambling machines,most guests were winning. Every guest looked very happy. The hotel was crowded, and we all had a good time. Hoping to make another visit soon. Andy Niyarepola,"
981,5.0,Beautiful Strip Venue,Beautifully decorated for the holidays. Front desk went over and beyond to get me adjoining rooms to be with my daughter and granddaughter. Wonderful entertainment at The Mayfair with singers who were great. All food I had was delicious and COVID restrictions were honored and I felt comfortable. A must stay in Vegas.
982,5.0,"Great Location, Nice Room and Excellent Service","Bellagio has nice rooms, buffet and restaurants were exceptional. The service from housekeeping, the front desk, valet, security, and the casino floor were excellent. I would go back again and plan to book another stay in 2022."
983,5.0,Good,We loved the room service and spa! We had a Fountainview I love the fact that the staff constantly wore masks room service was my favorite food was excellent but I didn’t like the food in the hotel The fact that all the stores were very close to hotel was very appealing as well
984,5.0,Luxurious Hotel Lives Up To Billing,"Place is strategically designed -- almost as if they had me in mind. Crap tables are in the middle. Cashier is close by. Great restaurants on the perimeter, and the decor in lobby and The Conservatory is outstanding. You valet Park, check in and off to your room. There is a nearby hotel that you have to valet park on one side of the property and walk across the casino, the shops and restaurants before you get to your room (that was 1 experience). Stayed, Ate and Gambled at the Bellagio on November 15-17 and later came back to gamble and eat on November 29-30"
985,5.0,Bellagio !,"Very nice - clean rooms, great service and beautiful grounds. The conservatory is fantastic. Everything is convenient getting around the hotel. The location on the strip is the best.. We were there Halloween weekend."
986,5.0,Great hotel and casino,Great place to stay in luxury. I am sure I will be back soon. Enjoyed the restaurants and casino. The rooms are great. Staff always friendly and helpful. Tanks MLIFE for the free parking and all the comps.
987,5.0,Excellent Choice,"Location, service and amenities make this my favorite place to stay in Las Vegas. I love the fountain show and the beautiful Christmas decor. There are so many restaurants and attractions within an easy walk."
988,5.0,Splendid experience,This was my first time staying at the bellagio and I had a great experience. I Had one issue that was resolved with 100% satisfactory. The staff were nice and the room was clean with an awesome view of the main rode.
989,1.0,Worst hotel stay ever,"Travelled with my wife and 7 year old and stayed for over 7 days, the worst part of our stay was that way to our rooms was through smoke filled casino and my daughter had to bear it everyday. This was tough for her mentally as she complained that she feel sick every time. Also, when anyone is travelling with kids, hotels should be more compassionate and provide basic facilities to warm food/water, rather than simply denying everything. I know Las Vegas is a place to make money, but if hotels support families, everyone will love them."
990,3.0,Pretty but they don’t come to clean,It’s a beautiful hotel but room service is seriously lacking….aside from that it’s peered to easy parking and great sights perfect spot on the strip. The fountains are just gorgeous. Really close to popular spots.
991,1.0,Don't plan on working out or swimming,"If you're here for an event, don't plan on working out or swimming in the pool/jacuzzi. Both don't open till 9am. The pool closes at 4pm. The fitness center closes at 6pm. I wasn't able to workout or use the pool area a single time because of these horrible hours. Other hotels in Vegas are not like this. Even if this wasn't a business trip, I would still like to workout in the morning and go to the pool area in the evening."
992,2.0,They do not care! Beware if you are not VIP status. No consideration of a guests needs at all!!,"Months ago we booked a Salone strip view suite for 5 nights Dec 6-11. We had previously stayed in Bellagio suites twice and were pleased. This time we were placed in the spa tower, a huge walking distance from everything! When we told them we were 69 years old and had mobility issues, and my husband even had to sit to rest to get to the buffet, they just said sorry, can’t move you—we are full. We told them we had no idea we would be in that area and they acted like we were dumb and it was our fault we were in that room, but no where in the description does it say how far it is to the main areas of the hotel. Besides that, our assigned room was at the end of the hall. We honestly needed a Segway to get around. To really make things peachy, the toilet roars, moans and groans when"
993,3.0,:(,The hotel is getting tired and in need of a refresh. Common areas are still beautiful but the rooms and amenities need a little TLC. Nothing management can not solve with the right focus. Covid related issues are obviously impacting the customer experience. Hopefully this was only a 1 time situation because Bellagio has always been a magical place for me.
994,5.0,Beautiful holiday decorations through out the hotel especially the conservatory.,I have never been disappointed at the Bellagio. Class through out the entire property. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Love the rooms. Clean and well designed. Service at restaurants always great.
995,5.0,Bellagio comfort,The rooms are freshly updated and very comfortable. A fountain view room is great for the fountain shows but are not as quiet as a room on any other side of the hotel. Nightlife comes booming from across the fountain waters all the way from Drais on top of the Cromwell (you can look out your window and see the lights beating with every loud boom vibration that you can hear clearly in your room). So the easy fix is watch the fountains from any of the restaurants or outside and enjoy a quieter room by not requesting the fountain view room.
996,5.0,My GO TO HOTEL FOREVER,The staff is incredible...the bedding is more than comfortable..I will be purchasing Bellagio bedding and pillows soon. The food is outstanding. Decor is marvelous. 1 million stars for sure. I love Bellagio
997,5.0,Fountain View,"The room- King Fountain View The room is fantastic lots of outlets. Bed and pillows are like clouds. Lighting is a little bright. No dimmer on anything. Even in the bathroom no nightlight mode. The view is amazing. I can watch it 1000 times. My number one choice to stay. Yes even over the Cosmo. Stayed twice during trip.. Fountain View 2 Queen Beds Beds and pillows fantastic. The strange thing no outlets in this room. They are in the side of the night stand and top of lamp other than that I could not find one. When I ironed I had to use the night stand plug. This room I had some issues with. The room was not up to Belliago standards. Dried up food on the carpet, makeup on the door and the vent was covered in dust. They did compensate for the issue. The staff from the front"
998,4.0,First Time Bellagio Stay,"I have been coming to Vegas for 20 plus years and got into a rut with 4 or 5 favorite places to stay. Caesars Palace is my all time fav. Paris is another one. Finally decided to stay at Bellagio. Have gambled here numerous times before. MGM MLife gave me several options and chose Bellagio this time. We completely enjoyed the Casino. Mostly played Dice. Tried 4 or 5 different tables during out stay, all the dealers were good, some were really outstanding in friendliness and service. Our room was a basic two queen room. The room was very nice but not as opulent as I expected. Also was surprised that there was no mini-safe in the room. Even 3 star casinos have the mini-safe. The bathroom was nice with a separate shower and tub. They also had two sinks in the counter which was"
999,5.0,Extremely easy check in,"Our stay was wonderful. We checked in and received our room key on their app. We arrived and was able to go straight to our beautiful and clean room. Everything we needed was in the casino, didn’t really need to leave."
1000,5.0,Great hotel,Housekeeping was doing a really good job. Staff in general is really helpful. The hotel and casino is really clean. The buffet was open 8am-3pm. The O show was amazing. the conservatory was beautiful and well maintained.
1001,3.0,Room was a disappointment,"Our room was on the corner of the building, our view was a freeway and the major boulevard. Not a good night of sleep. Our room was freezing! 65 to be exact, and no blankets were available. Such a disappointment"
1002,5.0,Royalty,"My friends and I were treated like absolute kings. 10/10 would come back here again. We arrived on a very busy Saturday, we were greeted with smiles to relieve our stress, we were given our room keys immediately, and arriving in our rooms we were greeted by cleanliness and absolute gorgeous views"
1003,3.0,Some staff helpful others were not,The in room dining staff were the friendliest staff to deal with. I ordered coffee and they arrived at the exact minute that I requested. The front desk staff on the other hand were not willing to help. We received a single king bed room but we needed two queen beds. The staff would not help and the only option was to pay $50 per day for a roll away bed. The issue was never resolved.
1004,1.0,Avoid this place at all cost,"Trust me on this, do not spend your top dollar staying here. Do yourself a favor and go to the Wynn or Venetian. Staff is rude, rooms are filthy, wait times without a reservation are absurd, cannot get a reservation for 21/2 days in advance to eat. Then they over charge 300% to order room service. And when the food arrives it’s cold! Horrible, horrible experience. I’ve been going to Vegas for 30 years and have never had such an experience!"
1005,5.0,Another great trip !!,Coming to the Bellagio for 12 years. Win or lose we always have a fabulous time. ALWAYS treated like a V.I.P. The staff and facilities are excellent. Have been to other casinos and none come close to how we are treated at the Bellagio.
1006,4.0,Wonderful time.,The Bellagio is a well cared for hotel. Slots are good but not a whole lot of variety. Seems to be the same one in different areas. Staff is very friendly and place is very clean and enjoyable. Had a enjoyable time
1007,5.0,Wish we could stay longer,"My wife loves the fountains. Picking a fountain view room was really cool to watch the variety of fountain shows. We only spent our last night in Vegas here, but wish we would have had more. Wonderful food options here."
1008,4.0,Stay was alright,The stay here was alright. I don’t feel it was worth the money. It was nice downstairs but the room was not what i was expecting. The spa was also not worth the price to enjoy the service. I do not think i would stay here again.
1009,5.0,Luxuriating at Bellagio,"Top notch hotel — from front entrance, to lobby, and, most importantly, the rooms. Retailers and restaurants on site are high end, but there’s something for everyone. Second time staying here and probably will be my go-to Las Vegas hotel from now on."
1010,5.0,A top notch experience,"The Bellagio is a phenomenal hotel/casino that offers everything from superb dining to excellent shopping. With very clean rooms with more than enough space, the Bellagio is a leader in an ultra competitive market."
1011,2.0,Rooms have changed...but not for the better,"For a premium Fountain View room (#26024), we were a bit disappointed for the price paid. We stayed here several times in the past 20 years among the other MGM properties and the changes was not for the better. There lacks storage four your clothes (two small drawers on the furniture that houses the Refrigerator and Ice Bucket. and the two bedside dresser drawers. The rest have to be stacked in the one hanging closet and left in your suitcase. They removed the tub for a long doorless shower. The Bathroom lights kept tripping the circuit breaker and found out that it was the one in the foyer by the closet. The bathroom lacked drawers or shelves for your toiletries. There is one open under the sink about three or four inches from the floor which they put the towels and"
1012,5.0,Blown away by the Bellagio!,"We booked our stay through Costco, and couldn't have been happier. The Bellagio is absolutely beautiful. Our room was sparkling clean. Food/restaurant availability was great. We can't wait to come back!"
1013,1.0,Dirty rooms!,"I had not stayed at Bellagio in 13 years. So after being a regular at Aria, we decided to switch it up. Upon check in to our room, we dropped our bags off and cranked down the ac to cool off our room while we went for lunch. About 90 minutes later we returned to a sauna. The room was over 90 degrees, even though the ac displayed 60. Called FD and we’re told they would send engineering up. While we waited and sweated, I decided to shower from the plane ride. Immediately I noticed the bathroom was not clean to a “5 star hotel” standard. There were long thick black hairs all over. In the corners of the bathroom was what looked like food remnants, etc… it was gross. Decided to look around further, found this pretty much through out the room. Stay away from this “5 star resort”"
1014,1.0,Was harassed 2 days in a row by a scammer christopher mitchell,"We've been a big fan of Bellagio until this past year, There's a well known local scammer named Christopher Mitchell whose constantly bouncing from casino to casino telling patrons, for $1000 he can teach them to win everyday gambling and directs them to watch his slimy youtube channel where his videos look like they were done by a 6th grader, He's the low level bernie madoff of Vegas. 5 months ago, Bellagio security assured us he had been banned from all MGM & Ceasars Property. Well sure enough, last week we popped in to do a few hours of gambling and there he was, in the slots area trying to sell people as usual. I tried to talk to security about this but theyre completely useless, I mean completely. Until Bellagio cleans up their act, EVERYONE STAY AWAY"
1015,4.0,You pay for what you get,If you book any trip using a booking site and get an amazing price do not not expect the best room with the best view. The room with two queen beds in the newly renovated was very small. The bathroom was large and very nice. The beds were adequate and there was nothing special. As my traveling companion stated the decor in the room was somewhat depressing. The staff were kind and we did get early check in.
1016,4.0,Beautiful Hotel - Expensive,"This hotel is beautiful with nice shopping and great but expensive dining options. Biggest disappointments included 1. High Table Limits (Most of the week at $50, then at $100 on weekend), 2. Fitness Center only open from 7AM - 6PM, 3. Food at Lily restaurant was brought over by Snack Shop (very limited and barely bar worthy, pizza is HORRIBLE and manager admitted the same - full refund issued)."
1017,3.0,Not family friendly,"Cassino has cigar smoke 24/7 and is the only/shortest access to the rooms. The room didn't have a fridge for guests but a minibar that you can't touch due to sensors triggering automatic charges. Something hard for a family with 3 little kids like mine (we ended up using a chair to difficult access to it). Parking garage gate didn't work using room key as expected, needed to call for assistance everytime when existing it."
1018,4.0,Beautiful hotel and spacious rooms- Lots to do in the hotel an very close to others and the mall,Beautiful hotel and spacious rooms- Lots to do in the hotel an very close to others and the mall. Great location. Mask mandate still in effect across Las Vegas which was annoying but they provided masks for you if you needed one :)
1019,5.0,One of the best casinos in Vegas!,First class service all the way! The hotel was exceptional especially during the holiday season. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. The staff was always helpful and fun. The casino and restaurants were well run.
1020,2.0,Too Expensive,"This property is too expensive. Table games, food, water, etc. are way over priced compared to other locations. We were there for fun and enjoyment, not to be ripped off. If you chose to stay at the Bellagio, gamble and eat at other establishments."
1021,5.0,Anniversary celebration,"Wonderful staff, excellent room very clean and great food although pricey. Casino has a lot of different options for gambling which was great fun and several places to relax and have a beverage also the casino was very clean. The shopping is very high end would be nice to have some shopping a little less expensive."
1022,3.0,Rooms were not ready,We got in around 8 pm for checkin and found our rooms were not clean and not available. They said short staff numbers were the reason. We downgraded the room just to have one available. Otherwise was ok but I feel bellagio needs to correct this or make it right for the customer if they are going to downsize.
1023,4.0,Just Ok hotel,"Overall the hotel is nice, but needs more attention to detail. Especially the bathrooms, ours was not so clean. In years gone by, the food prices were cheap, now they are astronomical, and way over priced."
1024,5.0,Wonderful Stay,"Outstanding helpful staff. Very secure hotel, security is a number one priority. Fantastic food options for the foodie lover. Health and safety is a priority for this hotel. Plenty of mask and hand wash stations located throughout the hotel. Staff ensure guests are following COVID protocols at all times."
1025,5.0,Bellagio Thanksgiving Stay,"Bellagio is an amazing resort, from the second you get there, you are welco.ed from the bell man and staff. It truly is beautifully decorated and the restaurants are out of this world. The weather was even better than expected!"
1026,3.0,Dirty Windows,"We booked a fountain view at the Bellagio specifically to watch the fountain show. We were extremely disappointed with the dirty windows. The windows were so dirty you could barely see out of them. The Bellagio promotes a fountain view, so they should make an effort to keep the windows clean."
1027,5.0,Bellagio at its finest!,The suite was very spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. Many dining options for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks! Prime Steakhouse is top notch and what an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains. Many casino games variety.
1028,4.0,"Great location, on the main strip, totally overrated in terms of value for money.","Great location, on the main strip, convenient, however totally overrated in terms of value for money. Extra charge for everything like simple room location change, even for providing spoons and fork, parking charge was okay but extra, too many extra changes overall for the mediocre service."
1029,5.0,Bellagio for the Win!!,"We loved the bellagio for our 3 night stay in Vegas. The location was ideal for our needs. Love the quality of the construction of the whole place. From the amazing lobby, to the pools, to the Uber comfortable rooms. Highly recommend and what a bed!! Cheers to MGM and the Bellagio!"
1030,3.0,Check in process & lack of follow-up,I arrived at the hotel around noon and the front desk told me that my room was not ready but that it would in just a couple of hours & that they would call me. I waited 3 hours and called and they said it was not ready that they would call I waited as long as I could do I we t back to the hotel at 7 a d they had no clue what was going on and told me that my room had been ready They made me waste an entire afternoon walking the lobby & casino waiting for my room The upsetting part is that they did not do anything to make us feel better and did not even apologize
1031,1.0,Pathetic treatment for families and children,"This is my worst experience so far staying in a hotel. The reason being I stayed with my family with a 7 year old daughter. Now, Bellagio made us and especially all the children walk through a smoke filled casino (as that is the only way staff suggested) to enter to our room. Even for adults who don't smoke its not good, but for a child it was so mentally harassing that every day she was scared to walk through that bad smoke smelled floor that she can vomit anytime. I have stayed in many hotels, and this is the worst experience for me and my child! On the top of that staff knowing that a child is going to stay simply denied basic facilities like microwave (to boil milk and water / heat food) and/or a coffee machine even though our stay was 6 nights! The only resolution I can"
1032,2.0,It's gone downhill a bunch.,"I've been staying at the Bellagio for years, I just got home today and it has gone downhill. Had an issue with my comp account and it took them 3 days to get it settled. No concierge except during prime hours. When trying to get help with our issue we got a big runaround. Also, the buffet is not what is used to be. It's expensive for breakfast and very few choices. It was mostly lunch Feds at 8:30 AM. No turndown service in out sweet or chocolates anymore. Mlife help was rude. Also, f you are concerned about the masks, they are not enforcing that at all. I would say 40% were not wearing them. Room is also getting tired."
1033,2.0,Full of crap,"My husband surprised me with this trip for my birthday. The first day of a four night stay feces started gurgling out of the room sink. I immediately notified guest services, but no one came to check on it until the end of our stay when we were literally walking out of the door to check out. Instead of offering to switch our rooms, they offered to take two cheeseburgers off of our room service bill. I expected so much more of an establishment so highly rated."
1034,2.0,Beautiful downstairs… spa tower rooms terrible,While heading for a relaxing and quick girls trip we chose to splurge and stay at the bellagio. Sadly after walking the spectacular lobby and downstairs the excitement to see our room quickly dropped as we walked in to a old hotel room that had not been updated clearly in years as the Ihome they provided port was for one of the 1st iPhone/iPods ever made the drapes looked stiff and ripped and the shower door couldn’t shut all the way. One of the worst parts is we were a group of 6 women in 2 rooms and both room doors did not close unless you slammed them which was a super huge safety hazard in my eyes. We worked with everything other then air as we aren’t here to do your quality control. the decor was very old and cheap looking. It was much like we went from a category 7 hotel
1035,5.0,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional customer service","The hotel is amazing, dining in the Buffet, Prime, Saddels or Noodles Restaurants was amazing with excellent service and delicious meals. The hotel holiday decor was stunning. I love everything about Vegas but the Bellagio fills my visits with beautiful memories. Sublime experience, with incredible service."
1036,5.0,Our stay for my Birthday & Thanksgiving,Need to fix the buffet line on thanksgiving we waited in line for 3 hrs and people wasn’t honest let people in in front of us and they sat at different tables. Wasn’t fair to people behind them.Great food but not worth the headache
1037,4.0,Bellagio,I really liked the room but the bathroom faucets were terrible and the toilet was hard to flush. The staff were very friendly and did everything we asked of them. I wish the room rate wasn’t so high for the last rep days
1038,2.0,Very Disappointed,"First off, our check-in experience was less than satisfactory. The gentleman we talked to was very rude to us, we asked if early check-in was an option and were open about having to pay more for the accommodation. The gentleman talked down on us and only spoke to us with a better attitude once we decided to upgrade our room. We were left very frustrated after the interaction. Once we got to our room, we were shocked when we found that it was very dirty, as if it hadn’t even been cleaned. The floor had not been vacuumed, there was food crumbs all over the floor. The bed sheets did not look washed, with stains and hairs strewn about. A dirty used face mask from a previous guest was wedged in the chair. The windows had not been wiped down, with smudges and grease all over the"
1039,5.0,Lovely conference recovery room,Spent a week at a conference and my room was a great place to return to and relax after a lot of information and small talk. The view of the fountains was particularly wonderful and mesmerizing and I'd recommend the extra spend for that if it's an option.
1040,5.0,Best Las Vegas Hotel,The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel styled in old world elegance. Everything is first class and the staff is wonderful. The food is amazing at all of the restaurants. Make sure to get a fountain view room so you have a great view of the dancing waters.
1041,5.0,Another very enjoyable visit to Bellagio,"Very enjoyable + way too brief a trip. From the minute of arrival at the airport, the prompt lemo service, quick + efficient VIP check in, comfortable room, fine dining + great gaming, until, sadly, time to check out + head home, all in all wonderful + relaxing."
1042,3.0,"Great property, poor service for value","For higher end rooms, the service is below average. Room service is non existent and there are maintenance issues. We reserved strip view penthouse suite and got a below average location and room from what was expected at that rate. Definitely better options are available"
1043,5.0,I would book at Bellagio all over again!,"what a view! very clean rooms as well! it is worse the money. The location is great as well. We had the fountain view room, and the view from the room is amazing. I highly recommend Bellagio Las Vegas"
1044,3.0,Expensive,I like it as a while but I think it’s a joke that a 5 Star Hotel charges you for the mini bar when it’s already expensive and then at the least they should offer breakfast or coffee. I loved the rooms and how cozy and how beautiful the view was.
1045,2.0,Not Special Needs friendly,"Our experience didn't go as we expected although we were very excited for our stay at Bellagio. Specially having a special needs child for whom we brought food from home specially made. Every night we had to explain ourselves to the In-room Dining staff to get our child's food warmed up, since there was some rules that we couldn't get a microwave in the room. In general some of the staff were very nice and professional and some were extremely rude, it felt like they hated their job. The most frustrating part was the warming of the food for our kid and spending 45 minutes over the phone explaining until a manager would talk and agree. The other thing that caught me off guard was the app, there's is no option to check out through the app to save time. I had to wait in line for"
1046,4.0,Excellent hotel on the strip,This gorgeous hotel and casino is in a great place on the strip. Has a tram that links 2 other casinos which is nice. The rooms are up to date and comfortable. Definitely an upscale hotel. Great location on the strip.
1047,1.0,"Nice hotel, overpriced and my room wasn't clean.","The Bellagio is a very nice hotel, obviously. I was assigned a room in the Spa tower, but my room had toenail clippings by the bed. Fairly gross and not cleaned, but the rest of the room was decent. Overall I would not stay here again."
1048,3.0,Not worth it at price they are charging !!,"Hotel is stingy by charging $$ for basic amenities - Water, using refrigerator, not providing microwave and exorbitant charges for food in room pantry ($22 for water bottle.. never heard such ridiculous prices !!)"
1049,5.0,Best place to live in Las Vegas.,"Bellagio has everything in house. I mean best casino, best rooms, best food, best buffet, best ambience and most attractive thing in Las Vegas (water fountain) all in house. Also it's close to major business."
1050,5.0,Excellent customer Service,"My wife and I are visiting the Bellagio for our 34th wedding anniversary.. On the 1st of December we ate at Prime Steakhouse. Our server was named Marcus. He provided excellent service. Today we woke up to figure out where to eat breakfast. I decided to ask the young gentleman that was providing security by the elevator (Mr. Vycheth). Mr. Vycheth went above and beyond to give us excellent customer service. He told us stories of meeting Ernie Shavers. He recommended a restaurant for breakfast (he was right), and more. Please let him know that we recognize and appreciate the job he is doing."
1051,4.0,Very busy hotel,Pros: Strip view suite was spacious with fabulous views of fountains and Eiffel Tower across the street. Our room was beautifully cleaned every day. Convenient location for great shopping and shows at nearby hotels. We had an enjoyable time in the casino despite being new to gambling. Staff there were helpful. Convenient check in. You can do it from your phone. Then your room number is messaged to you and your phone acts as a room key. Pick up for excursions was easy. There’s a dedicated ride share and tour bus pick up area Our room was set back enough from the street that the traffic noise was not an issue. Cons: We did not know about online check in until after standing in line for about 30 minutes at reception. No kettle or coffee machine in the room so we had to go
1052,1.0,Disgusting stay at Bellagio,The room was filled with hair in the bed and the bathroom the sheets had not been changed it was disgusting. I will not be going back it was my first trip to Vegas and it ruined it for me. We left a day early because by the time we got another room we could sleep because that room had a light that wouldn’t go off. Horrible experience.
1053,5.0,Soup to Nuts Satisfaction,"Wanna live Top Notch without the Bill Gates Bank roll, go to Bellagio…Don’t get me wrong it’s not inexpensive to stay there, but if ur gonna go someplace at a reasonable price, and experience high quality living, Bellagio"
1054,2.0,Disappointed!,"Booked a penthouse suite for 1 night to spend Thanksgiving with my family. Upon checking in at 4 pm I was told that the room was not ready and that I have to wait for a text notification to inform me when the room will be available. The receptionist left me at the counter for whatever reason and came back to tell me that there was an available suite room comparable to the one I initially booked. I agreed to take it. When I got to the room, I was very disappointed to see the layout, I hate to see a bedroom just separated by furniture from the living room. I don't see why this was even comparable to the Penthouse suite and yet I was charged the same amount. The carpet was dirty especially the carpet in the bathroom, it was so old and filthy. The bed was so uncomfortable. It was"
1055,5.0,Family Trip,Loved it! All staff members were outstanding . I made the right choice for my family. The view from my room was amazing. We also enjoyed taking pictures on the Christmas setting on the first floor. 🥰
1056,4.0,Stay at the Bellagio,"The Bellagio was a good hotel. Upon check-in we were told about a $300 deposit that we were not initially told about by our traveler’s agent. So that was a surprise for most, but of course was paid. The guy that checked us in was very friendly until one of our guests became upset about that price. His whole attitude changed after that. I thought the rooms would look a little more amazing for the cost, but the bathrooms were really nice, except for the hair being in the shower and on the bathroom floor. Everything else was ok during the stay."
1057,2.0,Bellagio,Check-in: the no touch online check-in through the hotel app didn't work. Then the non smoking king room I booked was not available. The room has hairs on pillows and on the sinks. The service was meh.
1058,1.0,Service = MINUS 0 stars,From the moment we were booked into our hotel room trying to find someone to help us was without feeling like we were bugging them was near impossible. How many times we were disrespected: 1. Pulled up in Valet - bell guy said he would take our stuff aside till our room was ready but said he wouldn't be the one taking it to the room which he stood there staring at me to tip him 2. Check in - was OK but didn't explain fully how to make your key card once you got the text your room was ready. Then when you ask they make you feel stupid 3. Getting up to our room - Elevator man so rude. We asked which floor we were on as I didn't have my glasses on and couldn't read the paper print out. I tried showing him and since our room began with a 6 I asked if it was 6th floor. He looked
1059,5.0,Beautiful location,Bellagio is beautiful. Centered on the Strip. Walking distance to many of the shows and events we went to see. Restaurants were hard to get in without reservations. The buffet had lots of options. The tables were set to be a good distance from the next table.
1060,5.0,Exceptional,"If your looking to go to Las Vegas I would highly recommend the Bellagio. This hotel has the perfect location, in the middle of the strip! You are steps away from shops, a ton of restaurants and stores. It has a walkway that takes you straight to Caesar’s palace or across to the other side of the strip! We stayed in a room with a fountain view and let me tell you, when the fountain show starts the view from this room is spectacular!! So when in Las Vegas don’t look to stay anywhere else, the Bellagio is the place to stay! With its upscale stores and restaurants you will be more than pleased! 🥰"
1061,5.0,Amazing experience Thanksgiving Weekend,"My family was here to support my niece who was graduating from nursing school. We all booked rooms and stayed at the Bellagio. During our stay the hotel amenities were great with no complaints at all. The server in the Casino was what really shined. I believe the floor manager who was taking care of Mark Sirota. He was very accommodating when we were at the Blackjack table. He always made sure we were happy with cocktail service, or anything other things we requested. He also made it very easy to create and enter our player card information. Our dealer Rommel was amazing! He was interactive and extremely funny. He was also dealing out some amazing hands for us, and we all walked away winners. This was one of the best hotel and casinos I have had in Vegas so far."
1062,1.0,stay away if you are travelling with kids,"staff are generally rude. Hotel is old and the room is extremely small comparing to the Encore suite. Our room is overlooking the fountain so it's nice to have a fountain view. There's nothing special about this hotel. If you travel with kids, this is not a kids friendly hotel. They closed 2 or 3 pools and open only one pool in November. We paid over $300 per night!! Also, you cannot take the kids to a lobby lounge areas because it's a bar! If you just need a drink or two, you need to find a restaurant that serve drinks. The high tea lounge also do not allow kids because it's part of the bar. funny!"
1063,5.0,A great hotel!,"A terrific hotel in a great location. Pricey but you get what you pay for. Very nice room, quiet. We had a room facing the fountains which I would recommend to anyone. Great restaurants. Would love to go back to this hotel."
1064,5.0,"Clean , high limits black jack,",Clean Ana staff was friendly. Loved playing in Valeria high limit black jack. Will come back . We need slot play or table play. we need complementary service from and to airport. We need tour of the town offered
1065,3.0,Not worth the money,"The service wasn't great, our room was not cleaned properly . The location is beautiful and the beds are great. I wouldn't recommend staying here. It is way to much money and if you want to do anything in the hotel it very expensive. The workers are not the nicest."
1066,1.0,Never again,"Don’t touch the fridge, they charge you in moving some bottles around. The fridge has a sensor that triggers when you take something out, even if you put it back in. Ridiculous! No toothpaste, no toothbrush, no slippers, no coffee maker, no microwave. For the amount of money you pay for a room, you’d expect a little added convenience. Never again."
1067,5.0,Great resort with amazing views and wonderful staff!,"We stayed at Bellagio for (unfortunately only) one night before Thanksgiving 2021. We got automatically upgraded to the Salone Suite on the 10th floor, which had views of the mountains on one side, and the strip and most of the fountain on the other side. The bathtub was also right next to a big window towards the strip and the fountain. The room was big, spotless, and the staff was very responsive, respectful, and friendly. We booked it through Amex Platinum, so we got an early check-in and late check-out and around $220 credit (2x$60 for breakfasts and $100 for any food), making the stay even nicer. But even without the credit, this is the best place I have ever stayed in Vegas so far (despite not being that expensive compared to other places we have stayed in)."
1068,5.0,Breathtaking view and great location,Got here around 3pm and waited in the long line to check in... Got superb customer service from Omelda! We originally had King Resort but needed 2 Queens so she got us Well Safe Fountain Resort Room. The room was amazing compared to regular room. (Floor 32 room 32038) The air purifier helped me sleep The bathroom was gorgeous! Loved their shower! Very clean room! Plenty of high end retail shops! There's a tram that runs to Aria / Park MGM Vdara is also connected to Bellagio. Good location for walking along the strip! Parking is $18 Thanks Omelda for giving my daughter chocolates for her birthday! Amazing weekend so far! xoxo
1069,2.0,Poor quality,"Checked in to room to find broken glass on the floor. One large towel had yellow stains streaking across it. One of the bed covers also had stains, but dark Grey in color. No vanity kit in the bathroom. There are multiple hairs on the shower floor. After day 2....No replenishment of the few Toiletries that are provided. The garbage isn't removed from the room. I could keep going but this is enough for me to not revisit or recommend."
1070,5.0,Wonderful Anniversary stay,They treated us like royalty. Would go back in a heartbeat. Be sure to have a fountain view room for the most romantic experience. Try Spago for the best seafood tower and close up fountain view. Overall great experience
1071,3.0,Bring food with you.,It is impossible to find food in Belaggio: lines to enter Buffet or Starbucks are 3 times around the block. All restaurants reserved days ahead. Minimum price to eat for one person is $50 per basic meal. Get ready.
1072,3.0,Avoid the buffet,"Check in was usual , we got to our rooms and noticed the accumulated dust on tables, bed frame, lights etc . Asked front desk yo send cleaners to clean the dust, we come back and room was neat but no one touched the dust. Issue was never resolved . Try to avoid the buffet, the food was old, dry bread, super dry bagel, stale dessert , old potatoes . It was horrible ."
1073,5.0,Good and check in friendly service room is great 👍 casino and casino Far East marketing is friendly and good service,Good and friendly service at check in casino Far East marketing VP Christine Wong she so Friendly and Professional so nice 👍 I meet her by the future I’ll back to Bellagio and looking Miss Wong she wonderful and so friendly that’s I give her Five stars 🌟
1074,5.0,Always excellent accomodations,Bellagio sets the standard high to excellence and they have maintained their standing. This was our 4th stay and we have no desire to stay elsewhere. We absolutely feel very comfortable during every stay
1075,2.0,"After many stays, very disappointed this trip.","1. got charged extra 6 x $22 for items in the fridge & snack bar we didn't consume due to ""sensors"" 2. paid $2000 for a fountain view that was obstructed with horribly dirty windows 3. No coffee maker or ability to make hot water in room."
1076,5.0,The Bellagio lives up to its reputation,"I requested a room with a view of the dancing fountains, and I was very pleased with our view. I really liked the digital check-in/check-out. The location was great! The Bellagio definitely lives up to its reputation."
1077,1.0,Faded glory,"A great hotel 20 years ago. It is a cut above Caesars now. Rooms are out of date, staff is harried, food is average at best and gaming staff looks like half dead zombies. The bell staff were good. Flowers were nice in the public spaces"
1078,5.0,Penthouse with fountain view,This was our first stay at the Bellagio. The penthouse with fountain view was phenomenal! I sat for hours watching the water show and the sun set. We enjoyed Thanksgiving day buffet at Bellagio and watched Cirque De Soleil “O.” Delicious and spectacular! Crazy long lines for the buffet but the food was awesome! I wish the buffet accepted reservations because we struggle with asthma and allergies breathing in the casino cigarette smoke for 2+ hours in line. The Christmas decor in the conservatory was amazing!!!
1079,3.0,Awesome getaway,"We loved staying here. Downside was the long lines at the buffet. Buffet was also very small for the price we pay per person. The 2 Queen room we stayed in didn’t have a fridge to store your own items and didn’t have your usual Coffee maker and microwave you’re used to having in a hotel room. Other than that, they should have a sign that lets you know that any snacks and beverages that aren’t in the mini fridge aren’t complimentary either."
1080,5.0,The way 5 stars should be experienced,"A well orgonized, clean, upscale and classy place. It's like a seperate island compared to other Casinos. I stayed at Bellagio many years ago and it did not disappoint again. We stayed at Wynn a week before this stay in Bellagio (Canyon roadtrip) and the statisfactory gap is apparent. We spent more at Wynn yet felt it was not worth the extra. Bellagio staff goes out of their way to accomidate, the design is gorgeous, I love how light it is compard to most cosinos that sometimes give a vibe of a large basement. We do not gamble, but the service of everything else was great. Will definetly return."
1081,1.0,Beware of the crowds,"Dogs pooping and peeing on the floor of the casino. Smokers everywhere. The room was nice enough, but I dreaded going out into the common areas. No beautiful people here - Just fat, poorly dressed crowds roaming around. We will not return. Oh, did I mention $18 for one cup of room service coffee- plus tip."
1082,5.0,"great , wish you add more restaurants and longer hrs for buffet and coffee shop","We enjoyed the stay but not enough restaurants and the ones open late needs reservations, We arrived tired because of the plane delay and we were hungry but unable to find a restaurant to walk in and eat ended up at the snack back which is not what we like . Hrs at buffet and coffee shop are limited"
1083,5.0,"Exceptional service, safety protocols, comfort, and attention to detail","Highly recommended. Exceptional service, safety protocols, comfort, and attention to detail. All staff we encountered were friendly and willing to assist if needed. The only Las Vegas strip resort we as (two sister's traveling together) feel safe and comfortable staying at."
1084,3.0,Over-Priced,"There are other hotels that are just as comfortable, on the strip, for a better price. There weren't many choices for late night snacks. If you are in the Spa tower, plan to trek if you want coffee in the morning. Bed was lumpy."
1085,5.0,Bellagio is Top Notch!,"Our stay at the Bellagio was fantastic! We received amazing service, the hotel was immaculately clean, and the food and drinks were delicious. We plan to return to the Bellagio sometime next year! I would recommend the Bellagio to anyone traveling to Las Vegas!"
1086,5.0,Very Nice Hotel,I had a great experience staying at Bellagio. Every staffs were very friendly and kind. I had a trouble with room keys for parking but the staffs were helpful. Great locations. Very elegant and classic hotels. HIghly recommended.
1087,2.0,Charging five star price for a three star hotel.,"Overall very disappointed and would seek other five star hotel that would actually offer five star facility, service, entertainment value among other important factors. I had a high expectation but the actual experience turned out to be not worth it."
1088,5.0,Bellagio is the #1 place in all of Vegas,We had an amazing Thanksgiving in Vegas! Bellagio is the place to be when in Vegas! Sure there are many places to stay but the people like Corinna Rambicur makes it worth it for sure! She made our stay perfect! She is one of a kind host and we love her!
1089,4.0,Nice casino,We enoyed our stay but honestly the rooms are not up to par. We expected more luxury. The fridge is completely unusable if you need to keep meds on ice for instance as it is completely packed with extremely overpriced beverages. Not even a token coffee to get your day started. Fine dining is excellent but casual dining is lacking. House cleaning staff was good and friendly.
1090,3.0,First stay at the Bellagio,"First stay at the Bellagio with my girlfriend. Although we had used MyVegas points, so can not speak too much on the value since we only had to pay the taxes. Good location since its in the middle of the Strip and has a separate parking for hotel guests. Though upon check-in the digital keys didn't work so we had to wait nearly 10 minutes to have someone come and assist us. Room was alright, Aria was nicer. But still better than most of the other hotels. The Spa Tower rooms are really inconvenient though considering how far you have to walk to get back. The Conservatory with the Christmas theme was lovely though."
1091,4.0,"Clean, spacious, comfy rooms","Our King room in the Spa Tower was clean, spacious, and comfortable. We had a view of the strip and could watch the fountain show from our room. It was quiet at night and I slept well. It is a long walk to the rooms but worth it. I would stay here again."
1092,5.0,Bringing customer service back,"After a few disappointing trips, I am happy to say that the staff at Bellagio are once again catering to the customer. Most staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and seemed happy to assist. The Bellagio Suite was roomy, the beds were divine, and everything was clean."
1093,5.0,Great experience,The hotel is extremely beautiful. The staff was friendly and courteous. It was a great trip with another couple. The buffet was delicious. There was so many varieties of food and free mimosas. The Christmas decorations in the Conservatory was unbelievable.
1094,1.0,Not what you would expect,Upon check in the toilet seat was not 100% clean. Room was outdated. No usb charging stations within the guest room. Missing decoration from tv stand and stained or dirty restroom door. You expect this from a motel perhaps but not when you're paying top dollar at the Bellagio. Seriously lacking value
1095,5.0,Beautiful venue,Hotel overall is beautiful just could not sleep on the bed it was like sleeping on a sand dune! Horrible mattress and covers weighed a ton. Mayfair was exceptionally excellent show and food. Loved it.
1096,5.0,Premiere experience,"Great but expensive Fountain view rooms at the Bellagio. Remember to ask for a higher floor - I'd recommend anything above level 20, or your view will be obstructed by buildings / trees. Only downside was the surprising use of a shower instead of a bathtub. I'd expected that for the amount I was paying I'd get a bathtub instead."
1097,5.0,Great Stay,Our stay was pleasant and relaxing. Everyone was very professional. I loved it. I was treated with respect and courtesy. The best hotel experience I have had in Vegas thus far. I plan on staying here again!
1098,5.0,Wonderful vacation!,"Wonderful hotel with fantastic restaurants, friendly, professional staff and updated, well appointed guests rooms. My beautiful room was located on the 16th floor and I was bothered by street noise well into the night. In the future, I will select a room on a higher floor. My only request is that the hotel management install coffee machines in the rooms or by request."
1099,4.0,An average stay,"Be prepared to be emerged in a crowded place with traffic preventing one from returning to the hotel after a night out. Smoke filled the casinos with drunks shouting early in the mornings. Men’s restroom needed more frequent attention. Restraints were exceptionally good, be prepared to pay the price."
1100,3.0,Bellagio Las Vegas,"Bad attitude of the staff, allway solve your questions but reluctantly, it looks they are doing a favor to you. the rooms are very clean, comfortable, love the bathroom. tv very small, old speaker. need to have aextra refrigerator or at least a biger one for personal items"
1101,5.0,Less stress and worth it,"I’ve stayed at other more adorable Casio hotels. Being a hard working individual, I decided to splurge and pay the extra and see what I’ve been missing. There is a noticeable atmosphere, less stress from the staff, friendlier guests and a more relaxed atmosphere overall. Yes you work hard, might as well rest easier knowing your investing in your peace of mind."
1102,5.0,Never disappoints!,"I go for the botanical garden display. This time, being that it was close to Christmas, I finally got to see the decorations and it's always picture worthy! The florals are breathtaking as usual. You cannot praise the staff for their perfection every time!"
1103,3.0,Over priced resort,"Hotel parking to far from guests elevators. Food was under cooked and over priced. Quality control was not noticeable. Casino was low on service staff over on the tables. Location was great , water show was wonderful"
1104,4.0,"Nice place, was great in its earlier days, very smoky environment",Great location on the strip. Didn't like the amount of cigarette smoke in the resort and fragrances being used to cut down on the smoke smell. Restaurant options were a bit limited as were the bars compared to other resorts in the same area.
1105,1.0,Property has deteriorated greatly over the years,"This place is expensive, overly crowded, full of cigarette smoke, bad service, disrespectful staff, table min limits are ridiculous IE $100+ per hand and hardly any tables open, practically impossible to order a drink on the floor (you don't even see a waitress), the food is poor and overly priced and there is limited options. Stay elsewhere!!"
1106,5.0,"Good Hotel, Good view, Good restaurant","The fountain show from the room was very good, and the food in the restaurant in the hotel was delicious. It would be better if you could listen to music while watching the fountain show in the room.."
1107,3.0,"A special hotel but don't expect to feel ""special"" unless you have status.","I decided to bring my family to Vegas for a quick pre-Thanksgiving trip as my mother and sister's birthdays are in December and can get easily overshadowed by Christmas. I splurged and booked the 2 bedroom ""penthouse"" suite which I read had the fountain view. I specifically booked this room because of the view but was sadly disappointed to learn my room has the view of the freeway and ""pool"" after waiting 40 minutes in line to check in. The room had two bathrooms - one of which had a lot of issues - the jets in the tub kept ""buzzing"" so we called maintenance, one of the tv's didn't work, and the in shower steam didn't work. Also, there was a big bag of old sandwiches (probably from previous guest) still in the fridge. It wasn't rotted but anytime something like that gets"
1108,5.0,Pleased as a pickle!,This was a most excellent adventure with my dearest family. It was spectacular to get out of my boring every day life and escape to such a splendid and delightful place! It was decorated to the nines and a treat to my eyes!
1109,5.0,Thanksgiving stay,"very good, good location, clean, views, convenient, nice location, nice decoration, tax , foods, clean, nice, fresh air, spas, like to come again, stay for last 12 years, good poker room, sports book,"
1110,5.0,Top notch hotel and casino.,"The location is great, the slots are up to date and the gardens are beautiful. The check in process was smooth even though the lines were long. My husband and I even enjoyed walking out to the pool wishing we had saved more time to swim in the heated pool."
1111,5.0,Great stay from beginning to end!!,"We had a great experience, from the caviar to the pastries. The staff very friendly and available when you needed it…the pool so nice the water so warm. I didn’t want to leave when it came time so say goodbye..but we’ll be returning soon…"
1112,5.0,Awesome,Staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. Room was super clean and updated. Need more variety in the casino slots though. Atmosphere is very customer oriented. We had a great time. Will definitely be back!
1113,5.0,"Beautiful Hotel, Very friendly staff.","Check-in and Check-out was a breeze, staff was friendly, room was beautiful, super comfortable bed and very clean. Location is on the strip and very convenient to many locations. It was an awesome experience."
1114,3.0,Staying at a tourist attraction,Staying at Bellagio on a Saturday night is a lot like staying in Times Square in NY. Thousands of people roaming around looking at the spectacle that is Bellagio and the animals playing games there. You are the animal.
1115,4.0,Loud DJ dance music till 3:00am,Penthouse fountain view rooms penthouse fountain view rooms should be sound proofed! Unacceptable music and base that rattled the windows. Lasted till 3am on multiple nights. Impossible to get any good sleep. Even with a white noise machine you can feel the base thumping. Totally unnecessary. Guest should be warned when booking these expensive rooms. Bellagio NEEDS to find a remedy for this. Invest some money in should proofing the windows. This is Bellagio for goodness sakes.
1116,5.0,Our Stay at the Belagio,"We ate at Prime which was more than we wanted to spend but the food and service was incredible, we talked about it for days. I had the Fillet Steak my girlfriend had the Lobster ,we finished with the Key lime Pie. Totally Amazing"
1117,5.0,Beautiful place,"Wonderful facility and pool deck. Good selection of restaurants and nice gaming floor, but unfortunately the table rules are tight and limits are high. A great place to stay, but would recommend gaming elsewhere."
1118,5.0,"Great value, beautiful hotel.","We had a great time, the staff is helpful, friendly and efficient, the hotel is gorgeous and clean, we got an upgrade at the front desk and the location is in the best area of the strip, overall memorable and wonderful!"
1119,5.0,Cut above a 5-star,"It would be almost impossible not to give the Bellagio less than a 10 plus for customer service, ease of checking in and out, quality and excellence. We had a top floor corner suite (601) which was an upgrade we didn't expect but were pleasantly surprised to walk into. If I would say anything that they could improve on it would be the mattress in that particular room. It was very soft and uncomfortable. It unfortunately gave us backaches and the shower drain was clogged and not draining well, but overall our trip was pleasingly successful. They put up their holiday decorations while we were there and those were amazing."
1120,5.0,Excellence at Bellagio,"Our stay was excellent. The staff is friendly and helpful. The facilities are fantastic. The custmer service is second to none. We have stayed at a lot of hotels over the years, including many in Las Vegas and very few make you feel that they are genuinely concerned about your experience at their property. The staff and customer service oriented culture at Bellagio demonstrates their commitment to providing the best customer experience possible. The facilities are wonderful and well maintained. The food and beverage options are equally wonderful. I highly recommend staying at Bellagio and when visiting Las Vegas in the future, I would not consider staying anywhere else. The Bellagio is simply the best!"
1121,4.0,"Perfect for the holidays, but just pay for a regular room","My room was very expensive, the Premier Suite.Unfortunately there was nothing premium about the room. Average room with dated amenities. No soaking tub, no smart tv. Old clock radio, no WOW factor at all, paper thin bathrobes. Disappointing for a $1700 for a 2 nights stay."
1122,5.0,Warm friendly and luxurious,"With fountains shooting dancing water high into the sky, the famous multi-colored lobby chandelier to the festively decorated conservatory,“The Bellagio” lets one know that you are entering someplace special!"
1123,2.0,Not happy,"11/26 I am a regular Bellagio guest. I gamble (heavily), dine, shop and spa a the establishment. I love it. On Friday I entered the platinum taxi line to leave for the airport. I was first in the line. A man from the main line (which was quite long at the time) complained I got to go first. The bell person explained I was a platinum and ask to see my card, which I produced. The same man that was standing in line started whispering to the bell person. Negative things about who I was and he should go first. The bell person shook his head in agreement and told me and my guest we could go AFTER the complaining man. I have NEVER seen non platinum go before platinums. It felt it discriminatory ( I happen to be a black woman). I didn’t like it and it is giving me a different feel"
1124,1.0,Not a great place to stay price is too high but service and room vet bad,Not a great price to stay for the room place other casino are cheap and best won’t recommended place for the new people to stay. House keeping is good toilet is bigger than the bed room to sleep water not good
1125,5.0,Raiders game / Sportsbook,Stayed on Sunday and watched the Raiders game in the Sportsbook venue. Ordered a bucket of alcohol and a plater which was great. The room was nice and huge. Overall I have a great experience. I will be back soon.
1126,1.0,Don’t bother: the fountains aren’t worth it.,"The Bellagio, while fancy to look at, did not hold up on our stay. We were told our room was recently renovated and it was old looking. The view of the strip was decent but the staff at the front desk will lie to your face making you think you’re getting great things that you don’t get at all. Would not recommend. Parking is also a nightmare. They need to get their act together."
1127,1.0,Tired. Sub par. Overpriced.,"We paid $600+ a night for a suite different from what was promised with no heat, dirt and crumbs. Food was horrendous. Service was sub par. Instead of helping us, they threw nominal credits our way. There are MUCH better places with much higher quality and better service."
1128,5.0,Place of wonder and full satisfaction,"The Bellagio is beyond Just being a Casino, it's a place of wonderment full satisfaction relaxing full service you can forget all your worries and enjoy your time in Las Vegas.There's no question where we will be staying when we return to Vegas the Bellagio"
1129,5.0,Business cum vacation trip,Clean environment of rooms ...supportive staff and excellent location for your stay in Las Vegas. Excrusions are easily accessible and anyone would love to come back to Bellagio again in Vegas Family or business trip do stay at this hotel.
1130,1.0,Many charges for fraudulent transactions,"Some issues with mini bar and missing Red Bull. Staff do not interest themselves with resolving this issue. Do not recommend business, or personal travel here due to an honesty policy issue. I took one figi water on the first day, was charged 71$ and blamed for missing Red Bull. One of the representatives recommends locking your mini bar on future trips anywhere as she was blamed for an entire mini bar fridge charge."
1131,5.0,Bellagio stay in Las Vegas,"If you are looking for a casino that makes you always want to return to the Bellagio, then this is the casino. My slot host is invaluable to me and my family. We feel so loved and cared for. The rooms and food are simply amazing."
1132,1.0,Not worth the money.,The view was great the rooms are not worth the price. Staff was not friendly. I will not ever stay there again. Limited table games. Bar staff was rude. Restaurant prices are very high and quality was low. The only good thing I can speak to is location.
1133,2.0,Past Its Prime,"I am an easy-going traveler, though my stay at the Bellagio was not good. I had several problems with my room that were unresolved (HVAC not working, inoperable in-room safe, malfunctioning technology). The hotel feels old and stale as compared to other luxury offerings like the Cosmopolitan and Aria. I would not recommend the Bellagio. Too many other good options in Las Vegas."
1134,1.0,Dirty Carpet,Stayed at Bellagio the week of Thanksgiving upon late night arrival we checked in on line and everything was doing great until we got to our room. Carpet had dried food you can tell what the last occupants ate too and the seat with ottoman had a big stain it was gross and disgusting but it was already late and we were tired from our flight so we didn’t ask for room change. It’s really sad I used to like staying here but service and cleanliness had gone drastically down. We stayed at Encore the rest of our stay and we were very satisfied there.
1135,3.0,Wanted to love...but...,"We decided for a long time if this was the time to take a vacation considering covid. We pondered, researched every hotel in Vegas (okay not EVERY but major resorts), and decided to go with the Bellagio. We had only been in Vegas twice. The first time to get married, and the other for business. So here is a pros and cons list for anyone considering the Bellagio and deciding on a Stay Well room promoted by Deepak Chopra. Advertised: mood music, comfy beds for sound sleep, air purification system, an alarm with mood light, vitamin C infused water Stay Well cleaning protocol. We chose this room due to the cleaning protocol. We wanted to vacation as safely as possible and cleanliness was the most important factor for us. Plus we had never been to the Bellagio and thought this"
1136,2.0,Overcharged for extra person through AMEX Fine Hotels. Ridiculous fridge restriction,"Booked through AMEX Fine Hotels program for two queen beds room (two adults and one kid). I noticed that the there is hefty extra fee (about $60 per day) for my kid in the same room, compare to just two adults' booking. Figured that's some additional cost to cover the kid for the benefit. WRONG! It's exactly the same benefits (up to two breakfast credit per day). So the extra fee does NOTHING! (the cost is more than a full buffet per day!!) Going forward, just book AMEX Fine Hotel as two adults (choose two queen beds). there is no reason whatsoever to give Bellagio extra fee for nothing!!! Also be careful with their ""fully computerized fridge"". It's pretty much fully filled with items that you don't want to touch. Even if you just move it, you will get charged. And the fridge"
1137,4.0,"Amazing view, room and great service","At the end of a road trip with kids we wanted to stay 1 night in Vegas before flying back home. I booked a 1-bedroom penthouse suite, which was as expected: huge, tall ceilings, amazing view of the mountains, pretty incredible. But one issue came up: even though I booke for 4 (2 adults+2 kids) there was no beds for the kids. The sofa was… a sofa. Not a sofa bed. So we had to call house keeping to solve for this. They brought two rollaway beds (the room was so big that it didn’t even crowd it 😅) but that was just bizarre."
1138,2.0,"Staff were awesome, stay was tragic.","The staff were great, if you are big on service stay here. We had a lot of problems relating to automated check-in. Given smoking room by the system after requesting non. Starbucks and coffee in the morning a challenge, asked by 4 people were Starbucks was while carrying cups. Need more amenities. Did not even attempt the buffet line-up, it was ridiculous each morning. Very expensive all around. Las Vegas seems to be moving away from catering to gambling and more towards tourist trapping. Do not get me wrong I can not fault the staff at Bellagio for a lot of the issues we encountered, they did their very best. The overall Vegas experience needs to be reviewed by some focus groups and standardized intelligent review panels. This was our 4th time there, 8 days, 7 days, 4 days and"
1139,5.0,Must stay,Beautiful hotel room with a great view of the strip and fountains! Bed was comfortable and room was very clean. The employees are friendly and provide exceptional service. Game play was fun and felt like we were able to play a while for the money we spent.
1140,4.0,Stay at Bellagio,Went on a family trip here. Was okay nothing special and think other hotels are better for the price. Overall it was an okay stay. But the bathtub was clogged and had residue in it which was a concern and had to call the front desk to clean it up. Luckily we don’t use the tub
1141,4.0,Good hotel,Overral hotel is great and Buffett area need be more organized/ plate was not clean. And steak chief was little bit careless and warm/ we come here it’s because of the name of the hotel. I love this hotel .
1142,4.0,"As expected, but the years have their effect.","Hotel is a staple on our trips to Vegas. It’s clean, well appointed with what we expect. The only real issue we had this time is the mattress. It felt more like a futon cushion, rather than a flat mattress. Other than than that, the room’s condition and amenities were in line with our expectations."
1143,3.0,FAKE FRIDGE,When the room is advertise and booked with an in-room fridge. Guest should be able to use it. I couldn't find even a small space to keep my probiotics in it since it was FULLY PACKED with hotel merchandise for sale. Literally the fridge in the room is not for guests to use.
1144,5.0,Beautiful and Friendly!,This is the most beautiful place on the strip. Service is excellent and staff if friendly and helpful. The fountain view rooms are wonderful! Food was delicious but you do have to wait. Casino is nice and cool with pretty good ventilation.
1145,1.0,Price Gauging,Local residents trying to help economy by having a staycation in Vegas. Charged $50 “resort” fee then $22 for a bottle of water in room. Asked for credits of some sort at checkout and both front desk and MLife personnel declined to help.
1146,1.0,worst stay,"So many. When we arrived, we waited for more than 30 minutes to get our rooms cleaned. The rooms were missing the amenities and towels. I had a 20% off coupon from my company, they said oh we cannot apply it here. I don't where you'd apply it. I said okay because my parents were tired. Your key system crashed while we were getting our keys. Waited for another 20 minutes. Then, at 5.30am, alarm went off on the floor. We called front desk three times, and noone answered. my mom had a panic attack. the alarm went off the second time. Still called the front desk - not a single soul answered. I got out, and saw an employee. She did not say anything - she just said elevators are working. No indication of what happened, whether we are safe or not. We went down the stairs. 25"
1147,5.0,Top Notch,"As always, 5 star experience at Bellagio. Try the Patisserie for Breakfast. Crepes A+. Security by elevators good, rooms awesome. Lobby and new Xmas Town I'm the conservatory were beautiful. Overall great location and experience."
1148,1.0,Never again,I booked 2 suites. This is a review for one of the rooms. I stayed in a Salone Strip View Suite in the Spa Tower on the 23rd floor. View of the fountain was beautiful but the room itself wasn’t all that great. Room was clean but definitely looked rushed. Alarm clock and tv didn’t work. Sinks in the bathroom made weird noises. No robes. Light in the bathroom went out while getting ready. We ended up missing our dinner reservations waiting for someone to come up and fix the issue. I think staying at the Wynn would have been a better choice for us.
1149,2.0,"I recommend another hotel, not this one. Too many problems with the room and service.","1. Shower water pressure was very low. Engineer came up and said that they could not raise it higher because it would spill out. Pressure was so low that it resulted in us being very cold. Please, go take a bath in room 25 48 and see how you like it. 2. There's no room heater, or least ours did not work. Very cold room for the entire stay. 3. Fire alarm or some other alarm went off at 5:30 in the morning waking all of my family up and continued alarming for about 30 minutes. My daughter was crying and none of us could fall back asleep because of it. We were also highly concerned whether it may have been a fire or a shooter or whatever. I HAD to ask in the morning about how your team was going to address it, and only a $45 hotel fee was provided. I shouldn't have to ask, and I"
1150,5.0,Superb customer service!,"Beautiful Hotel and Casino. This was our second stay. We especially like the efficiency of the front desk staff, numerous places to dine and shop and the casino. Bellagio is a spot we will return to over and over again."
1151,4.0,Bellagio thanksgiving,"Overall we probably wouldn't stay here again - for the price tag, the rooms are comfy but you could easily be charged for using something without realizing it; communication wasn't clear between staff regarding different policies; you can easily stand in line for an hour at the buffet only not to be served (despite being told you would be)"
1152,5.0,Bellagio Las Vegas,"We love this hotel. Staff is great and rooms are clean and have everything you need. You can walk across the street for the mall. Spago and the Prime Steakhouse are a must everytime we come to Bellagio. Thanks for always a great stay. Now if I could just win, lol"
1153,5.0,5 star rating,"Always a great experience when we go to Bellagio, the customer service, the rooms and the casino are all wonderful. We will definitely book the Bellagio again for our next trip stay. We recommend this hotel to any one."
1154,5.0,Bellagio Review from a 23 year old,The Bellagio is really nice and it had everything you need it was easily convenient to get from place to place if you’re not gonna take a taxi the food was great and there’s great food nearby the casino and all of the casino game people were really nice and they help you understand games if you never played them the room is very big the room is very very big And I couldn’t be more impressed with the cleanliness of the room and all the maid staff were phenomenal and they did a great job making sure my room was clean every day and making sure not to touch any of my personal belongings. I do overall rate this place nine out of 10 not 10 out of 10 just because I mean if I wanna million dollars then it would be 10 out of 10. Bellagios a great place to say and I look forward to
1155,1.0,Misleading,"I had the same experience as one of the reviewers- “fountain views” are misleading. Paid extra for the premier rooms($515/night) but all we got was the view of the road. When i called the service desk - we were offered upgrade to “partial strip view” for $60 per day and since i was disappointed , we got the partial view of the strip at a “discounted” rate of $45 per night. I was told that people paid extra for fountain views - if so, so did we assuming that we will get the view of the fountain. We have two small kids that were looking forward to fountain view and we had to explain to them that we won’t have fountain view. The whole point of booking room at Bellagio’s was for the fountain view. Very disappointing. If you are booking for fountain view - ensure again and again to"
1156,5.0,Family vacation,Very clean and great service from front desk and housekeeping . The room was very clean and we got the very great view of the fountain. Beautiful to see at night time. My kids loved it. The buffet was also very good.

1159,4.0,Beautiful Property,"Everything was beautiful, but there were a couple issues we had with the room. We had a room temperature problem. When we arrived, the room would not cool down and we had to call maintenance to fix the air conditioner. Donna came in to fix the problem after the first technician came in and switched the mode off of ""eco"" mode, but then after he left the unit stopped blowing air. Donna was very thorough and checked the unit, the vent, and the filter, which was dirty. She even let us know that in order to keep the air blowing, we need to keep the temperature at 60 degrees. She's very knowledgeable, and we appreciated her help! This is the third hotel on the strip that had poor room air flow. Very disappointing. The others were the Venetian and NYNY. Other than that, the bathroom"
1160,5.0,great stay,"I stayed in a fountain view room, it was spotless, beautiful and very roomy. The description said there was a curtesy shelf in the fridge, there was not, but that was not an issue. The concierge was very helpful and the property was clean and sanitized , very safe feeling, everyone had a mask on . The buffet was great and the service was top notch. I would love to stay here again"
1161,2.0,Poor service,The service was terrible. My husband tried to call guest services and was on hold for over 10 minutes before he gave up. Good thing I was able to check in on the app. The line to check in was ridiculous. When I did get someone on the phone she was rude and snotty. I was not given the room I paid for. We won’t ever stay there again.
1162,4.0,Billing errors,"Billed for snack and beverage items, that I did not use or take. Front desk notified, said it was resolved, but I was still charged. I’ve seen similar complaints on tripadvisor. Hotel was nice otherwise. Frustrated about the billing error though. Check your bill prior to leaving!"
1163,4.0,Great Location with very nice rooms. But don't go to the gym if you really want to exercise.,Plus+++Rooms and staff were very nice. Experience was good. We had fun even though we donated $3000 to the casino. Minus-----They make you wear a mask in the gym even if you are running. Food and drink seems to be very expensive compared to 6 months ago.
1164,5.0,28was great,The hotel and it’s staff treated us with much respect. We would definitely come back to stay at the Bellagio when we return. Christmas decorations was beautiful. We were greeted with such a positive attitude.

1169,5.0,Clean and great service from start to finish,"Worth the money. Close to everything walking distance and clean casino and rooms. Got upgraded to the new stay well tower. Rooms were clean, no lingering smoke smell, quiet. All staff members from valet, bell hop, front desk, m life and room service was exceptional. Thank you Bellagio!"
1170,3.0,Misleading Fountain View Rooms,The Fountain View rooms or Strip View rooms are not what they show in their pictures. 100% misleading. I’m sure any jury will reach that conclusion. Parking lot view! That’s what you get. I complained about it. Said there was nothing they can do and that is the view I paid for. No I don’t think that is the view I intended to pay for based on the website and how you portray images per room type. That is definitely not what I paid for. Talking to someone who doesn’t get paid much make sure even harder because the tone already sounded like they don’t care. No willingness to help. I booked this stay to enjoy the view. To not have to go outside. But the view was a joke. No one wants to look at a parking lot and then told that in the far distance you can see the strip and the
1171,5.0,Awesome stay,Awesome stay beautiful rooms and great showers over all very clean. Enjoyed our stay there and will be staying again for sure. Loved that it was so close to everything on the strip and shops. Very nice
1172,5.0,Don’t hesitate ti book,I promise you won’t be disappointed ! We traveled as a family and to be honest the view was everything was extremely beautiful we enjoyed the water show so much as never before is like another whole level stayin at Bellagio
1173,3.0,Below Bellagio Standards,"Bellagio has been my go to hotel in almost every single trip to LV since 2013, and I can way I have been a loyal customer without joining a program. However, in my most important trip, my honeymoon , Bellagio has failed me! I expected a hotel like Bellagio would celebrate with with me my wedding, having that mentioned in my booking and informing the front desk, but what to say, in a day and after calling and asking for cleaning my room twice in a single day, I return to my room without having it cleaned and tidied!"
1174,5.0,Favorite hotel on strip,"Love this hotel and will stay there every time, but if you don’t want to hear the club noise make sure your not in the North wing for your room. Only time in all the years we have that issue. Every other time our stay has been perfect!"
1175,3.0,Resort is wonderful. My room was horrible and the bed was old.,Resort is wonderful. My room was a huge disappointment. The rooms bed was old and sunken in the carpet was tattered and worn out. We went to Vegas for a week and wanted to stay at the best. What better then The Bellagio. Or so we thought. Again beautiful place but the room was a huge disappointment.
1176,5.0,Another great trip!,"Spent most of the weekend in the hotel. Ate at Prime which was amazing. Saw the ""O"" show which was totally awesome. Spent a day at the pool and spa, and the casino through the night. Overall a great trip!"
1177,1.0,Not impressive hotel,"I would not recommend this hotel due to poor service, room was dirty, you can heat traffic noises from 18th floor, and everything is expensive. Bathrobe was very old and dirty. In room dining was trying to charge me $13 for a cup of hot water."
1178,4.0,Beautiful Hotel,"The remodeled Stay Well room was Beautiful! The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was gorgeous. The Conservatory was decorated for Christmas and was awesome! Two negatives- the circulation must not be that great because it smells so bad like cigarettes, it’s awful, my other negative is I don’t like having to pay a “resort fee” when I get nothing in return! No complimentary breakfast, I even asked for a room upgrade because I was celebrating my birthday, but nope!"
1179,5.0,A Dinner over the water followed by rest.,"We feared arriving late for our dinner reservation, but with the help of staff, found ourselves checked in and being seated right on time over the fabulous Bellagio fountain show. Our dining experience at Prago was fabulous, the comfortable room a restful retreat."
1180,5.0,Always a great stay!,Ive stayed at Bellagio a number of times and always have a great experience. Staff are friendly and always available. Amenities are plenty with choices to eat drink and have fun. Its centrally located and convenient to everything.

It is the place for all ages people. Wish it will be prosperous and doing better and better in the holiday seasons and the coming year of 2022!"
1183,2.0,A five star hotel with three star service,"The hotel charged me 70 for opening the refrigerator door. They waived the charge after I made a service call. The staff told me I supposed not to open it. But there is no any sign in the room and I am not suppose to take a look the refrigerator in my room. I used the e-key and wanted the second key for my wife. The MGM app said it is easy to make it at any kiosk station but I didn’t find any in the hotel, even in lobby area. I asked the staff in lobby and was told to get the key in front desk which always has a line. The staff was not very helpful. The location of this hotel is convenient and the fountain is amazing. But not the service. Not recommended."
1184,3.0,Way too loud!!!,"My Fountain/Strip view room at the Bellagio was beautiful. Very clean and view was great. My only complaint is the extremely loud music. My room was on the 9th floor and there must be a club below because every night the music was so loud that it was impossible to sleep. Not what you want if you want a relaxing vacation, or if you've been drinking all day."
1185,5.0,Amazing Hotel,"First time visiting Vegas so we decided to stay in the Bellagio is and amazing hotel, beautiful views. Amazing customer service and very clean. The casino is amazing and the restaurants are to die for"
1186,5.0,Bellagio Experience,"The service excellent, rooms very clean and spacious. Food quality divine, staff very professional. Will recommend to others. Shops are great. But the Water show, who would have thought that water and music go together."
1187,4.0,It was Okay,"This is the third time staying at this property and it seems to have slipped in quality and atmosphere. The biggest complaint, the entire casino was smokey, even my room smelled like smoke. I am now using an inhaler to clear up my lungs."
1188,5.0,Weekend Vacation,The hotel and casino was amazing. The room was way better than expected. The environment made you feel safe and worry free. The location makes it a perfect place to check out the rest of the strip. Definitely one of the better places to stay on the strip.
1189,5.0,Fountain view room for our anniversary,We stayed at the Bellagio when we got married 11 years ago (honestly the Ocean's 11 movie was the impetus to stay there). We had planned to return to the Bellagio for our 10th anniversary in 2020 but had to cancel due to COVID. So we stayed there for our 11th anniversary this year and got a fountain view room this time. It was magnificent!
1190,4.0,Great Anniversary Stay,My wife and I checked in on Thursday only to be greeted by Maria at check in and she is truly outstanding. Maria made us feel welcomed and right at home immediately. She went out of her way to help us with an upgrade and our room was just perfect. If not for a disaster at Spago it would have been better. Thank God the Wynn saved the evening
1191,3.0,Room needed an update,"Definitely expected more from this upscale hotel - room not terrible , but definitely needed an update. Casino nice, so were the restaurants, but rooms are the most important and would not stay here again based on them. The MGM rooms are nicer"
1192,5.0,Impressive,"Great property, Staff was very helpful...one small glitch - check-in was at 3:00, I arrived at 1:00 but didn't get to my room untill 4:30. They offered a $100 food/bev credit for the wait. Realizing they have 4000 rooms, I wasn't concerned. Room was first rate. Impressed with the attention to detail. Ordered room service and it was apparent that hey are trying to provide a contactless experience - such is the way things are right now. The Casino - still allows smoking."
1193,3.0,November 2021,"Great location, nice rooms. I was followed by a scary homeless person all through the shopping area and casino floor and had a hard time finding security to report it. I was in actual fear for my life and unable to sleep all night after that."

1195,3.0,It was fine but not amazing,"My wife and I decided to go to Vegas this weekend for my birthday. We were able to get a comp room from the myvegas rewards so we decided to try the Bellagio. I booked one comp night and then paid for another night using the mlife discount. When we arrived, I tried the $20 trick and it failed. The front desk clerk did combine my 2 reservations so that we did not have to check out and back in again but she did not offer any complimentary upgrades. She actually upsold me on a fountain king room for an extra $100 a night. I bit, since this was our first time staying here, plus the standard king rooms have not been renovated yet. The first thing I noticed on the way to the room was that it felt like we had to walk miles just to get to the guest elevators. The room itself was"
1196,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,"Bellagio is a Beautiful Hotel. Very Clean and all staff very accomodating and friendly. We utilized the online checkin via the app which worked out perfect and there are several kiosks where you can print a room key if you choose. Save yourself the wait in line at check in. They were trasitioning to Christmas decorations which was fun to watch. Rooms were large, spend the extra $ for a Fountain View room.Totally worth it!"
1197,2.0,Unexceptionable,Hotel staff comes in the room when “They think no one” is in there regardless of the privacy notice they do not care I have no clue what they look for but if my privacy notice is on my door PLEASE give me privacy. They walked right in the room once I left but what they didn’t know was that someone else was still in my room relaxing.
1198,5.0,Great vacation,Everything was great at Bellagio. Buffet was awesome. Rooms very clean and smoke free. Don’t do well with smoke in the casino. Wish there was a better ventilation system. I did not go to the casino for this reason. Other than that had a great time with my friends.
1199,5.0,Great hotel but…….. need to read if you like to gamble,All tables are a 25.00 minimum all of the time. Great place to stay but we gamble at the hotels around it and have a great experience at them. Would rather play at the Bellagio but not at 25.00 a table…….. and the Bellagio had a lot of open tables with dealers and no gamblers
1200,5.0,A MUST STAY,"Gorgeous Hotel! The newly renovated rooms were simplistically Beautiful in the Bellagio way. Friendly/Helpful staff and awesome amenities. Definitely can't wait to return. Location was key to strip a hotel, providing equal travel times to different areas of the strip. Of course, the Fountain show is always amazing and with a Fountain view room, there was nothing more beautiful than enjoying with your loved one."
1201,5.0,Great stay,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for her birthday, 4 nights. The location of this hotel is outstanding. In the Center of the strip and walkable distance to almost everything. We were able to receive an early check in and used the self check in process. It was quick and worked to save us from the line in the middle of the day. The room was quite well appointed and very comfortable. The bathroom was perfect with a great bath and shower. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The automated curtains and sheers were a nice touch of convenience. I would agree with the recent comment about the temperature of the room. We also had a challenge getting it cooled off at night to sleep. We used the hotel spa for a massage and dined at Spago; both excellent. Spago"

I have attached a picture of the shower and there is a gap between the door and the wall at the bottom of the shower. Expressed this safety concern to the front desk in hope of getting a room change and the response was there was nothing they could do because that's how it was designed... So please be cautious when walking into the bathroom during or after someone took a shower."

After this stay I will choose this location over the Park MGM. Everything was wonderful about this property."

1220,3.0,"It’s okay, but there are better options","Not bad but not great. There are better hotels (Cosmo, Vdara, Aria, Encore, Wynn, Caesars). Small minor issues: room had outlets that did not work, broken hairdryer, and housekeeping did not show up on one of the days, even though we called to ask for it."
1221,5.0,Must stay,Clean hotel. Extremely organized and newt. Rooms were clean and service provided immediately upon request. Very accommodating hotel and perfect location!! Highly recommended. Also one of the best caviar Bars I have been too
1222,4.0,Nice overall property,"Well known for the fountain display. You don't need to stay there to enjoy it though. One of the more expensive properties on the strip, go over to the Cosmo for food if you want a to keep a few bucks in your pocket. Casino really didn't have much play ability for my (slots)"
1223,1.0,Disappointing,"I expected the rooms to be extraordinary, instead I got faux luxury. There were stains on towels. Water pressure in shower was weak. The windows were dirty, mind you we had fountain view. The room dine in service was overpriced and not at all worth eating."
1224,2.0,Unpleasant staff and experience.,"nothing good to say. staff did not represent hotel well. the only great service we received were from the maid service for our room. the crap machines were out of order, and two of three took my money due to error with the machines, which were not resolved by staff and management. many slot machine were out of order and service."
1225,5.0,Bellagio - Perfetto,"Excellent service, extremely clean, first class all the way. Best on the strip!!! Very happy that the Sports Book was smoke free. From the check-in to the check/out we were treated so well. The O show was such a great show. Well worth it. Hopefully we will be back soon."
1226,3.0,So-so,"Wasn’t thrilled with the room for the price. I expected a better experience, newer room, and just a better quality stay. There were broken or non working fixtures in our room and it seemed very dated."
1227,5.0,Best resort on strip,"Beautiful resort that has everything you need! Pool area and service was incredible. Recommend a Miami Vice! Room service is delicious. All staff is friendly and helpful. Wish it were a smoke free environment....Hallway noise is really bad in the rooms and smoke comes in from somewhere, even on the 27th floor."
1228,1.0,Renovated but still seedy,AC didn't work. Room smelled of urine. Apparently the room was recently renovated. Casino is smokey and unpleasant. Limited breakfast options. Buffet is worst In Vegas. Not worth the money. There are better 3 star hotels in Vegas.
1229,5.0,Very satisfied with my sty!,Very satisfied with my stay! I will recommend for any one to stay in this property. Definitely promoted the fountain view of my suite in all of my social media’s so people can enjoy and experience a nice stay in Las Vegas!!!!
1230,1.0,"Loud, expensive, unhelpful, and overpriced","Unacceptably loud. The fountain was loud, the plumbing was loud. Guest services said they knew noise was a problem but no, they wouldn't give me ear plugs. I could buy some from the hotel if I cared, though. This turned out to be a theme, as everything including water was an extra charge with no thought to customer service or quality. Food in the hotel was vastly overpriced and mostly sub-par. Sadelle's was nice, except for the service. The pools were nice."
1231,5.0,Request a Strip/Fountain View!,"Getting to watch the Bellagio fountain show from our hotel room was awesome, especially with a view directly across of the Eiffel Tower, as well as a peek at the High Roller - great lights at night! Make sure to ask for a Strip View!"
1232,5.0,The fountains are still magical,"Was a dream to finally stay in a fountain view room at The Bellagio and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Beautiful decor, hotel room beds are crazy comfortable, staff are amazing and really make the guests feel special."
1233,3.0,Meh,What was once new is now old. The rooms don't compare to the top hotels anymore. Lots of Construction going on. The resort is very much removed from the strip. No mid price food or drink options. Parking and resort fees will add another $60 per day to your bill.
1234,5.0,The Bellagio is still the best hotel in LV,"After more than 10 years, I visited the Bellagio for a 2 night stay. I had a renovated, lake view room. The hotel and room was impeccable, the staff was friendly, and the ambiance was comfortable. Now it’s part of the Hyatt hotel for accruing rewards. I’ve always had a great experience at Hyatt hotels. Recommend the Bellagio for anyone who prefers classic understated luxury."
1235,3.0,Glad to get home after 3 nights at Bellagio,"Always wanted to do Vegas and Bellagio was recommended. However, our stay was full of disappointments: 1. Hardly any water pressure in the shower. Is this deliberate to cut down water usage? 2. Plumbing was tired and in need of updating 3. Concierge desk was not manned all the time 4. Hotel does not sell stamps or postcards. Am I old-fashioned? 5. Business centre was unattended when we went there one morning 6. Traffic noise - double glazing should stop this but it doesn’t work. 7. No coffee making provision in room. Room service will take 30 minutes and nearly $20 to bring you a coffee. 8. Restaurant opening times not are posted on line and not always displayed outside the restaurant. Pot luck whether they are open when you turn up. 9. The problems with staffing in restaurants"
1236,1.0,Beautiful hotel but terrible service,"We came to watch O show and flowers, but received poor service everywhere. 1. Checkin: we arrived early and asked if we’re able to check in. She processed us immediately and told us to wait for text message to get key produced. After waiting for 30 minutes for the text, I asked a staff when the text message arrives and was told that we’ll get the message only when room is available. Nobody told us that no room was available earlier at checkin time. 2. Checkout: we finished checkout at the lobby console without getting any receipt in email or text. After waiting for 4 hours we went back to ask for the receipt. The staff told us that the email system is working and asked me to check my mail box. I showed my mbox, which has other mails from bellagio, including this customer"
1237,3.0,Average Experience at High Cost,Our room service took a little over 2 hours to come and the food servings were small. There were lines for everything as well (hence the room service). They also did not credit our final bill with our resort credits.
1238,5.0,AMAZING !,"Every time I stay here at the Bellagio is always an amazing experience, great service at any Casino area, great food, great fountain views from my room and my wife loves the Spa and pool area...Happy Wife = Happy Life."
1239,3.0,Waiting for days to get room we ordered,We wanted to check in Via are Amex a couple hours early but they didn't have any rooms available even after our check-in time so I opted to upgrade to a suite for five hundred more dollars per day but the manager gave that room away after we agreed as well for surely the front desk number stayed on top of it and helped us in the end
1240,5.0,Super Stay,"Great stay at the Bellagio, with a room on the 23rd floor and great view on the fountains. The staff was super accommodating and friendly. The food was excellent and available 24hrs for in-room dining."
1241,5.0,weekdays at the bellagio,"we went for a pre thanksgiving getaway, and were delighted to find the crowds reasonable, and the service was still top notch. the bellagio was beautiful, well maintained, and the fountainside night views were extraordinary. we dined at LAGO, and the food and service were excellent."
1242,4.0,Room,Just wish we didn't have to downgrade rooms to get a bathtub are first room had a better view of the strip so it suck when we had to move to the forth floor but it was a easy and stressful move from room to room
1243,5.0,The Bellagio,"Beautiful resort, great location, newly renovated rooms. The service was excellent as well as the attention to cleanliness. Enjoy d watching the Christmas display being assembled. Excellent value. Would definitely stay again."
1244,5.0,There's no better place to stay in Vegas!,We love staying at the Bellagio when we go to Vegas. It's really beautiful and is always so well maintained. We enjoy seeing the seasonal displays in the conservatory and especially love the Fountain view rooms so that we can catch as many of the great fountain shows as possible. The central location on the Las Vegas strip makes it the perfect Vegas location. Staff has always been so friendly and helpful to us as well. And we really look forward to eating at the Bellagio buffet each time we visit. It's excellent an buffet!
1245,5.0,Awesome Experience,We usually stay at the MGM Grand but decided to give Bellagio a try. It has become our go to hotel. The service from check-in to check-out was absolutely phenomenal. Looking forward to our next stay. Highly recommend the Jasmine for great Cantonese food.
1246,5.0,The Staff are amazing,"All I can say is from now on I only staying at Bellagio. Great location amazing staff, clean room and great food. I highly recommend Bellagio to all my friends and co workers to stay at this place. All I can is amazing place."
1247,5.0,Great Hotel,Wonderful location with great services and the rooms are great and nice and quiet with great security to enter towers and excess room area. Nice shopping within hotel and wonderful hotel staff ready to assist you with what ever you need.
1248,5.0,Facilities and Service,The facilities here are well-maintained. Check-in and checkout was a breeze. The staff was helpful and friendly. Dining was efficient and tasty. We especially enjoyed saddles for breakfast and the specialty restaurants located in the casino.
1249,4.0,Beautiful but pricey as hell y’all,"The Bellagio is pretty sweet but be aware of the hidden fees. No coffee maker in the rooms, the staff is top quality ❤️ The food and drinks are expensive but delicious 🤤 The hotel lobby is really beautiful 🤩"
1250,5.0,Bellagio visit,"Great stay, but pricey. Nice location on the strip. Buffet was really nice and food tasty- not just breakfast items, brunch items too. Conservatory a must see. Caesars right next door and they have a great brunch as well."
1251,4.0,Drais noise,"Hotel was great, food was 2+ hours in general for dinner, gambling was fun but high end, Drai’s club noise until 2:00am was excessive. Bring a noise machine to partially mitigate the noise. Great hotel with a few challenges."
1252,4.0,It’s iconic,"The Bellagio is still my favorite place to stay in Vegas, but you will definitely need to be prepared to spend double whatever you think it will cost. 1 Fiji water from the room was 22$ 🤯 when you show up you will learn about resort fees and all sorts of other unexpected fees. The hotel itself is beautiful and the casino is great. The biggest issues are always the unexpected fees… they try to tell you the lowest price they can to get you there… then they take it to you"
1253,2.0,How the Mighty Have Fallen,"We usually stay at Palazzo, but wanted to check out a different hotel and understood Bellagio to be a direct competitor. We will not be staying at Bellagio again. We waited over 3 hours for a room, they did not come through on all their apology promises. Our room was all the way across the property from the lobby, casino, restaurants, shops and parking, we spent most of our time walking to get where needed to be. The room is overdue for a maintenance closure. The furniture was all very uncomfortable, we were in a small suite, but didn't enjoy the room at all. They charge guests for parking, despicable! Any time staff answered a question we felt like we were inconveniencing them and rattled off responses meant to get us to walk away, but not really to help. Food venues were"
1254,3.0,Average at best!,"While the view of the fountains was stunning, it was certainly not worth what we paid for this room. We’ve been to many other hotels in Vegas, better prices. Similar views. Over priced booze here too."
1255,5.0,Fountain view was marvalous.,I splurged and got a king fountain view room. It was fantastic. When i wasn't gambling or eating I was in front of my window with one of my cameras in hand. I got a tone of good shots and will vbe back again next year.
1256,5.0,An amazing Birthday stay,We came to the Bellagio for my 27th birthday. Every person we came into contact with was so friendly! Corinne at check in really took the cake. She sent up some Champagne & chocolate strawberries for my birthday along with a hand written card. Touches like that really is what makes the Bellagio stand out from the rest.
1257,5.0,Easily met all expectations,"Easily met all expectations. Very clean property, comfortable beds, friendly staff. Great location. Love the fountains. good restaurants. very business and family friendly. Will definitely come back and stay here again"
1258,5.0,Great hotel!,"My husband and I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Bellagio. The hotel's common areas and rooms have been updated and refreshed. Mask mandates were strictly enforced at the blackjack tables, which made me feel safe while playing. Every staff member encountered was friendly, accommodating, and helpful. Cannot wait to return!"
1259,4.0,Nice place to stay but too price to play,"Our Stay - We used to stay at the Mirage, but when Bellagio became an affordable option, we moved over to this property. Our room was lovely. We stayed in the Spa Tower for the first time, having usually stayed in the main tower. We had a nice Strip View Room, that included a view of the fountains. The best part of the room was that the elevator went down to the pool level. We did not have to walk thru the casino or elsewhere inside, and with having the wear masks, this was a great feature. The patisserie close to our room was excellent for coffee and baked goods for breakfast. Housekeeping service was also great and our room was always ready when we came back. The pool was a nice place to spend the day as the weather was fantastic for November. The Play - All of us in our"
1260,5.0,The view!,"Staying at the Bellagio has been on my bucket list since it was built and I finally got the opportunity to stay. We upgraded to a fountain-view room and I'm so glad that we did. Every night, when we were sated with dinner and drinks, we returned to our room, opened the curtains, moved the loveseat to the window, and watched the fountains until they finished at midnight. That, alone made this a five star experience. On the more average side, but not enough to lower the rating, our room didn't have a hair dryer when we checked in, but that was quickly addressed by the housekeeping staff. The bed was comfortable. The mini-bar is overpriced (so head to the CVS across the street to stock up). The blackout curtains do their job. All-in-all, it was a great experience I will cherish."
1261,1.0,Horrible Experience at Bellagio VIP,"Terrible service from check in to check out. We had the 2nd most expensive suite, the grand lakeview two bedroom suite and we were treated like trash. Room was dirty, cigarette butts in balcony, Shower not working, Tv not working, No BUTLER as advised, and no room service as they said you need to call 24 hours in advance. Who calls for room service 24 hours in advance, Overall terrible experience, will be taking my gambling, shopping, and dining to Wynn."
1262,1.0,Worst experience,Management does not care if you have any issues during your trip. Reservations team made a mistake and would not honor the rate I was paying. I never asked for anything free I just wanted the rate I was promised. Was given the runaround. Ended up paying the price due to my elderly grandmother in another room they did not care.
1263,5.0,Bellagio is the Best,"Girls trip to Vegas. Absolutely best hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. Everyone from front desk, maids, restaurant staff, concierge, were friendly and helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay excellent."
1264,4.0,COVID struggles and changes,"I come to the Bellagio often to stay, but had not visited since before the pandemic. You can tell everywhere in Las Vegas is running on a skeleton crew. There are long wait times for taxis and restaurants, which are operating on shortened hours. Bellagio is no exception. Their room service menu has been drastically reduced, and wait times to get anyone to answer the phone to take your order are very long. A few times I gave up. Once when I called in the middle of the night they said there was no cook and to call back later. I am trying to be patient and understanding as I know things are tough due to the pandemic. My only real complaint about my room is the shower. I’m staying in one of the new Wellness rooms and the shower is almost a trickle. I have to struggle to get enough"
1265,5.0,The Fountains and the Staff will Amaze,The Bellagio is known for its beautiful fountains and we were blessed with a suite right in the middle of the show. But it is the staff attentiveness that will amaze you. From check in to check out they are committed to making your stay amazing.
1266,5.0,Fantastic Experience!,Stayed in the fountain view room. Wow! Watched multiple shows from our room while looking over the strip. So incredible! The pool area was very enjoyable and well serviced. The buffet was the best. I’d do it all again.
1267,5.0,Great hotel and casino in an excellent location,"The Bellagio is our go to hotel casino when visiting Las Vegas. The rooms are very nice, the location is great and the staff is very courteous and professional. We always enjoy our time at the Bellagio even though we always leave a little poorer then when we arrived."
1268,5.0,Great birthday stay,"This was my first stay here , and I was celebrating for my 33rd birthday. It’s a little expensive for the deposit. 150$ per night. But overall I really enjoyed my stay. Housekeeping did a great job, as well and the front check was very nice."
1269,5.0,Lucky in Las Vegas,"Spontaneous stay in Las Vegas and the Bellagio came through. Not cool to have to go through the smoky casino during a pandemic but once we got to our room, felt safe and so comfortable. Convenient to enjoy the Strip and quiet when we wanted to sleep. Ideal!"
1270,5.0,Best Hotel on the Strip,"Trust me if you are thinking of visiting Vegas, the Bellagio is the best you can get! Especially if you get a room over looking the fountain, it is amazing! And the hotel is clean, and always friendly staff. The pool is the best ever, with great food and drink service. Also you never have to wait for a cab at the Bellagio. Trust other hotels not the same. Do yourself the favor and stay at the Best!"
1271,5.0,Picky Travelers,Bellagio hands down is the nicest place to stay. If you want a mature classy crowd stay at Bellagio! Penthouse suite is amazing! The split bathroom is great for couples! Mlife rewards are worth it so sign up if you’re going to gamble.
1272,4.0,Bellagio id my favorite on the the Strip.,"Bellagio is always is a good choice for staying on the Strip in Las Vegas. Very centrally located to other casinos, restaurants and shops. The rooms are very clean and updated. The food is always good. I just wish they had a 24 hour cafe/diner."
1273,5.0,Still Top Hotel in Vegas from my perspective,Beautiful hotel with professional workers at every level. Great location. Had a Premier Wellness room with an overview of the Fountains. Very clean property. Huge pool area with great drink and food service.
1274,5.0,Still the best!,"My husband and I just returned from our stay at the Bellagio. First time back since February, 2020 due to the pandemic. The hotel has not only survived, they have renovated and refreshed the rooms and common areas. We got a renovated room and it was perfect. My only complaint was the ridiculously, small safe mounted on the closet wall. Very impractical if you wished to lock up more than your wallet. Housekeeping was daily and did a terrific job. Spago was crazy delicious. We also enjoyed dinner at Harvest and Jasmine while there. Also very good meals. The Petrossian Bar is still staffed with the best, most accommodating bartenders. Our one regret was that some of the regulars had been shifted to other venues within the hotel so we couldn't see everybody. This hotel"
1275,5.0,Fantastic Experience,"Friendly and helpful staff during a busy time. We were rushed at check in as we needed to get to a Raiders game and our front desk person was excellent. Room was very nice. Restaurant experience at Michael Mina after the game was exceptional, especially as we were one of the last parties of the evening."
1276,5.0,Best hotel in Vegas!,Stayed in renovated Bellagio tower so had a front row view of the iconic fountain and a postcard perfect view of the Las Vegas strip. The room and bathroom (especially shower) was spacious. This is a top tier hotel with great restaurants and service. If you go don't forget to check out the seasonal floral display in the central rotunda. The creativity and imagination behind these displays is amazing.
1277,5.0,Short and suhweeeet.,"We were in Vegas for a week with family, but I decided to take the wife and spend one night in LUXURY. We got a room high-up overlooking the fountains. What an AMAZING view! The fountains danced for our amusement and delight every 15 minutes for 4 hours! If you think they're cool from the street - you ain't seen nothing! The music is simulcast on the television so that you don't miss a thing. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with large windows that afford great views. They also have wall mounted controls that let you open and close them from the bed - shutting very tightly to allow you to easily sleep-in if you desire. There are plenty of available outlets and even USB ports built into each night stand to allow for easy charging of devices. The bathrooms, again, are"
1278,3.0,Hotel Stay,"Hotel is getting to be a bit dated and showing wear and tear. Check in was problematic as there was a long line and only three staff to assist guests checking in to the hotel. Mask wearing mandates were confusing and hard to follow. Over the weekend not enforced, Monday morning strict enforcement."
1279,2.0,Spend your money elsewhere.,"We spent 2 nights in a ""Penthouse Suite"" the room was riddled with maintenance issues - too many to list here. Clearly nobody is on top of quality control. A simple walk around the room would have detected a toilet that wouldn't flush - light fixtures that work broken or didn't work at all .. its a long list."
1280,4.0,Beautiful but…,"Bellagio is elegant in many ways but during our recent stay,we were disappointed with the cleanliness of our room and the ability of room to contain noise from the outside.With the price we had to pay,we expected nothing less."
1281,3.0,This is not a 4 or 5 star resort,"Not especially clean. Bedding smelled. If you like a firm mattress, you will not sleep well here. Pillows are huge. Rooms provide absolutely zero to make your stay easier. Nothing is provided in the room. Not a place to keep a cool drink, no easy way to have coffee delivered in the morning or ease of use when it comes to ordering room service. Egregious pricing. I did have some drinks from the mini bar, but to not even offer a complimentary water bottle is not good service, It’s completely lacking. How they can claim to be 4 or 5 stars is beyond me."
1282,5.0,Bellagio,"Great stay at the Bellagio, primarily business travel but I did find time for some leisure :) Would def stay here again, all MGM properties are usually top notch but the Bellagio goes over and above Thanks"
1283,2.0,"5th trip to Vegas, worse one.",Very slim chance they treat a gold level member any better than a new player! There should be plenty of perks! Room safe never opened I called 2 different times! A/C could not cool room under 70*… over all very let down by the casino and room experience! Hoping to find a new resort for future stays…. Multiple time customer Matt Gantner.
1284,5.0,Beautiful stay!,Beautiful updated room with a gorgeous view of the fountain and the perfect location to get to everything we needed! Right in the center of all the action. Loved capping off the evening watching the water show and lights on the strip. Gorgeous sunrise views for morning coffee.
1285,3.0,Room was great. Phone app SUCKED,"Spent over two hours trying to get on the stinkin elevator. Front desk associate couldn’t get the card issued. She was just like m, too bad”. I don’t come to Vegas and stay in a place like this so I can spend so much time getting your technology to work. Awful!"
1286,2.0,Poor rating from frequent patron,pros check-in was fine cons - had a farthest room (12-042) so the wife and I had to walk far to get to room. This was difficult because after a long day of site seeing and shopping we had a to walk further to get to the room. - guest room was not cleaned on Sunday until after 4p. Wife and I wanted to take a nap but room wasn't clean.
1287,4.0,So/So,"We were there for the Chiefs vs Raiders game(yea Chiefs won!). The hotel was fine. The bathrooms are large but a bit dated with older tile on the shower walls and sides of the bathtub. Bed was comfy. Elevator access to the rooms was a hassle, especially traveling with friends. You couldn't choose any other floor other than what your key was programmed for. I get it...its a safety precaution but it was a hassle nonetheless. Of course the resort fees and parking are ridiculous."
1288,1.0,No enforcement of mask mandate,"The resort makes a continuous effort not to enforce the mask mandate. They allow people to walk in unmasked, check guest in without masks, allow them to get on elevators without masks… This is all a choice. The Wynn, on the other hand, was enforcing the mask mandate. MGM has made a decision to not enforce the mask mandate. In spite of what they have said in responses to other such comments, they are not “falling short.” This is there policy and choice. They are putting guests and employees at risk."
1289,5.0,Always a Great time,"What's not to like about the Bellagio? EVERYONE from the front desk, M-Life (Rewards) Security, Concierge and Janitorial were VERY friendly and professional! Every time I come here it's always clean and inviting."
1290,5.0,A+ Hotel and Casino!,"The Bellagio is hands down the best hotel and casino in Las Vegas! The rooms are beautiful but, the staff is what makes it so great. I recommend this hotel and casino to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay with awesome staff members!"
1291,5.0,Nice hotel in center of strip,Very nice hotel with good restaurants at the center of main Vegas strips. Many hotels and casinos are in walking distance and has free tram to other MGM properties. Casino have lots slot machines and table games and payout seems reasonable
1292,5.0,My Bellagio Experience,"I have stayed at Bellagio over the years but this last trip prompted me to write my first Trip Advisor review. This year I chose Bellagio because it's where our conference was taking place. I was also hosting my company's annual team meeting. We had a block of rooms that were booked at various times through various mediums. I must admit to say it was a bit confusing was an understatement. I was so fortunate after waiting in a LONG line for check-in that I happened to get the kindest, most patient and professional front desk associate, Sandra Paredes! Not only was she patient but ensured that my team was not going to have any issues when they checked in the following day. She went the extra step to call me as the rooms were becoming available. She must have read how I"
1293,4.0,Honeymoon Trip,"We stayed at the Bellagio for our honeymoon, and enjoyed most aspects of the trip. The location can't be beat, and the rooms were clean. We did have someone smoking on our floor and the smell kept wafting into our room. The proximity of the parking garage compared to the guest elevators is great compared to other locations - it was nice if you have a lot of luggage or plan to leave the hotel a few times. Overall, we will be back but may opt for a smoke-free hotel. Also, you MUST get dinner at Yellowtail. It's the best!"
1294,1.0,Lobby person,"Never go to casino in Bellagio Hotel, the slot machines endlessly gobble up people's money. I didn't earn at least 1 dollar in any of the machines, but lost huge amounts of cash. Do not ever go to this casino, or you'll waste your time, money, and even ruin your life!"
1295,1.0,No enforcement of Mask Mandate Whatsoever,"Unlike the Wynn, the Bellagio allows and seems to even encourage guests to not wear masks. Nobody stands at entrances or near the elevators with masks or to ask people to wear masks. People are everywhere without masks, even on elevators, while checking in at reception, at the casino cage… Everywhere!"
1296,5.0,Excellent service excellent accommodations,"No need to travel abroad for a world class experience. It’s right here in the USA! Bellagio staff, rooms, dining and service is all world class. We didn’t even come to gamble, we came to be pampered and treated like royalty. We were not disappointed at all!"
1297,5.0,Best stay,"Everything was wonderful but my favorite thing was the beds . Oh my goodness they were the MOST comfortable bed to sleep on and if you get the room with the fountain view it’s 100% worth it , very entertaining and such a beautiful show."
1298,2.0,Dirty room,"Initial room was dirty, nightstand, clock and carpet still had vomit on it and one of the two sinks were clogged. Left a poor impression of room cleanliness. Had to switch rooms after discovering this which was annoying since we had already settled in. Otherwise good location since it’s in the middle of the strip."
1299,4.0,"Everything Amazing, except the cigarette smelling room.","Everything Amazing, except the cigarette smelling room. Staff was all very helpful and the location was awesome. Close to everything. Our stay would have been out of this world, but our room reeked of cigarettes 🚬."
1300,4.0,Great room! Great location! Great Pool!,"Besides waiting to check in and sometimes long taxi lines...the hotel room was beautiful, comfy, and the location can't be beat! Make sure to make reservations for breakfast as well as finding brunch on a sat morning is impossible and you'll have to head off strip. Besides that...super great stay 🙂"
1301,5.0,Great post-COVID stay in Las Vegas,"Our StayWell room was nicely appointed, although a bit on the smaller side for the price we paid. The restaurants were exceptional. We had wonderful dining experiences at Sadelle's for breakfast, Yellowtail and Michael Min's for dinner."
1302,4.0,Average rooms,"The view of the fountain is great, but the room was very average. If you are going to spend that much money on a room you should stay at the Venetian because most of their rooms are suites. You are basically paying for the name recognition and the view of the fountain (if you book a fountain view)"
1303,2.0,Not what it used to be,"I made a reservation for 4 rooms all in the Bellagio. 2 reservations with 2 rooms each -- our group grew in size after the original reservation was made. When we got to the hotel we tried to use the app to check in to skip the long line, didn't work app prompted us to go to the front desk. Once at the front desk, they told me there were 2 reservations for one room each. Luckily I flag all my emails based on specific trips so I easily brought them us and showed them that my confirmation was for a total of 4 rooms. It took an hour for them to our our room situation. Problems didn't end there, when we were checking in 1/2 of the rooms were the wrong room type than what I had booked and received a confirmation for. The hotel told me marketing had overbooked the property and there"
1304,5.0,Very nice room,We got a great deal on our room. The amenities in room were very nice. I loved the shampoo and conditioner and the bathrobe. Blackout curtains were awesome! We had a fantastic room service breakfast. Wish I could’ve stayed longer.
1305,4.0,Fountain view rooms not worth the $,"Windows are very dirty, fountains are noisy at night, and noise from music at bar in lobby could be heard on the 9th floor! Location on the strip is good, atrium is always a treat. Hours for Sadelle's are too limited."
1306,4.0,Too Crowded to be Luxury,This is a beautiful property with too many people. Jack hammering construction at the pool in Nov 2021 was horrid. Lines to get food. Lines to get in elevator. No coffee in room. The prices are very expensive but that is to be expected. They charged me $145 to send to my house a small object left in my room.
1307,5.0,We will definitely stay here again!,Was the most relaxing part of our trip. Excellent service! Room was amazing and the view of the fountains was the best! Amazing staff and very clean facility. Very comfortable beds as well. Keep up the good work!
1308,5.0,Great place to stay in Vegas,"The Bellagio is a wonderful resort. The rooms are clean. The staff is friendly. The lobby areas are my favorite of any Vegas hotel- tastefully designed - beautiful lobby, great shopping and restaurants. Poker room is also one of the best in Vegas - although it could be larger - sometimes the wait to get on a table is a bit long."
1309,3.0,Don't trust reservations at this hotel and noise level of adjacent property,"We booked 7 night 2 bedroom fountain view suite and placed deposit. Upon arrival were told room not available. We were bumped to a smoking 2 bedroom suite with view of interstate and Rio hotel. Next day they did get us into 1 bedroom fountain view suite but not what we had planned on. Even on 33rd floor, noise level from the Cromwell hotel rooftop bar across street went until 3 am. Coffee restocking was inconsistent."
1310,1.0,"Not Worth It!!! Nothing ""premium"" about it!","Nothing premium about it. The room was ""old & tired"", way over due for updating. Room was supposed to overlook pool... was overlooking the roof. Carpet dirty, bathroom needed cleaning and should have sparkled, stains on the bathrobes, one bottle of water in room cost $22. The food in the 3 restaurants we ate at was Way over priced for the quality.. mediocre at best, but was less than that even. Drinks hard to come by or not offered at all on the floor while gambling. Surprised there were no door persons to control who comes in to this high priced property. Were located on non smoking floor, but people all over this floor smoking everything. Noise and rudeness from other guests at all hours of day/night. Would not stay there again."
1311,5.0,Bellagio continues to be to top of the Vegas Hotel game,"Spacious room with a gorgeous mountain view (frankly a great change from our usual fountain view). It was quiet, well appointed and tons of space. I cannot recommend the Bellagio enough for their continued friendly, welcoming service and the consist quality of the amenities. Never change!"
1312,5.0,Birthday Fountain view,"I got to stay here on a comp from MYVegas for my boyfriend's birthday November 2021. We each had a reservation and got to combine it so we did not have to switch rooms. I requested to stay in the main building near the elevator with a fountain view. Our request was granted by Patricia at the front desk, for an extra $50 per night for the upgrade. It was well worth it, a fountain view is a must if you stay here at least once. I personally did not try it but I hear you can sync your tv channel to tune in to the song playing with the fountain show. This was a much better experience than when I stayed back in August 2021 when the upgrade was $70 per night for a queen room in the main building overlooking the pool. Needless to say, this is a great resort and a great location."
1313,5.0,The best stay!,I really enjoyed my experience! The hotel is beautiful one of the best on the strip by far! I really didn’t think I would ever be able to afford to stay here but so grateful I was able to! I got a really good deal and I really hope in near future I will be blessed to be able to stay there again! :)
1314,3.0,Very nice hotel but,"Family fun and nice place, but honestly if you like to play slot machines don’t expect the courtesy of a drink, waiters ignore you completely, even if you called them they act like they did not see you, then they promised to comeback but they never do, it is better that you buy your drinks if you wish it"
1315,1.0,Faded glory,"Bellagio used to be a premium property but it is garbage now. Food was terrible. Service was even worse. Room falling apart. Would never say there again. They were unable to be nice, helpful, kind or effective."
1316,5.0,Gorgeous!,Rooms were spacious and very very clean. I was here for a short business trip. Also the staff and room service food was delicious. I would definitely stay here again. The Cirque de soleil show is a must-see!
1317,3.0,Petty Charges,Charged us $50 for the use of THEIR fridge because we put a few personal items in it. Had to beg for $250 credit for unused contents we placed back in the fridge on our departure day. They locked the fridge remotely and it took hours for the maintenance person to reopen it.
1318,5.0,Birthday wish,First time at Bellagio very friendly and professional. Took my wife for her birthday we had no complaints. Will be going back. Will recommend to friends and family. Right in the middle of everything no need to drive almost everything within walking distance.
1319,5.0,Still a classic,Great hotel. Great people watching Fun weekend Highly recommend Picasso. Club fixed is great. Pool great Staff friendly. Close to shipping. Loved it and have been coming since the beginning. I wish jasmine was own during the day. Staff great on directions and ideas
1320,3.0,Disappointing stay,"Check in staff was great, floor staff was terrible. The room I had in the Spa Tower was fine until I had to listen to loud music until 2:30 AM in the morning coming from the plaza below my fifth floor room. Food in the restaurants we visited was very good. Too many other MGM Resort hotels to stay in but not here again"
1321,3.0,Cigarette smoke everywhere,"Great property, bad smoke. Too bad they allow smoking, it is pervasive. Other than that it was a great experience. Pool was fun, food was good, staff was just fine. Next time I will find a smokeless casino."
1322,4.0,Decent Stay but expected more,Kudos to the restaurants: Lago and Le Cirque. Amazing meals! The front desk and concierge went over and beyond to make the stay worth while however expected more details in the room. The room was recently renovated but lacked the toiletries expected in a Diamond property.
1323,5.0,A perfect stay at the Bellagio,"We were in town for a convention and stayed at the Bellagio, on the 16th floor in a suite. I wish we didn't have to leave for the meetings, the room was so perfect. Almost soundproof, great bed, amazing view. The staff was attentive and nothing was a problem. The casino floor was packed but again the staff kept things reasonable. The Bellagio is worth every cent."
1324,5.0,Very fun very easy,"I love that I can skip the hotel check in and just use my phone to check in and use as my room key. The quality of the hotel and casino are also top notch, you know that that don't skimp on the finer things."
1325,5.0,I love the Bellagio and have gone frequently. The mask mandate is a problem.,The Bellagio is my favorite resort. The Jasmine is probably one of the best restaurants I’ve ever visited. I don’t plan to return until mask mandates are lifted. It really takes away from the exclusive experience I’m use to at the Bellagio.
1326,3.0,Bellagio has issues following Amex FHR guidelines,"The Bellagio checked me out of my room before my scheduled Fine Hotels and Resorts check out time, charged the card I had on file when I intended to use a separate card for incidentals, deactivated my room keys and locked me out of my room. I have made 3 separate phone calls to the hotel after my check out day as well as sending in emails with the requested form to have my room charges transferred to a different card and in a weeks time the Bellagio has done nothing to help me. I feel like I have been ignored. I should not have to jump through hoops to correct an error the Bellagio made."
1327,5.0,Bellagio visit,"Always great service at the Bellagio. Wait staff excellent at Sadelle's,great food. Very clean hotel. Didn't win much at the slots, but still enjoyed the stay. We will stay at this hotel when we visit Vegas again."
1328,3.0,My requests were totally ignored! The smell was terrible,"1. The perfume was terrible. At booking I was assured housekeeping would use NO additional perfumed sprays? I called the day before check in and they said the room would be left empty to ensure no spray would be used and housekeeping would verify no spray prior to check in. None of this happened. The smell was so strong, my husband even felt the impact of the spray. It was tough to sleep - with allergies. When I called Guest Services, I was told that ispray is what they use on the Wellness Floor. Why was I not told? The hotel was booked and I could not change rooms. 2. I requested no housekeeping service - yes housekeeping came in while we were gone."
1329,3.0,Beautiful but uncomfortable when trying to move about,"We loved the beauty of the hotel but it's not designed for a group of people. You cannot gamble 24-7. They might want it, but it's not feasible. We wanted group drinking sessions and meals. We wanted a spot to hang out and have our morning coffee. We wanted to relax and watch the fountains, perhaps from a bench for twenty minutes. There's absolutely nowhere to sit because they want you to be uncomfortable as they funnel you through the casino. Gambling is fine. We had fun gambling. We ultimately loathed the experience because there's simply nowhere to sit and spend thirty minutes chatting with your friends while having a cocktail or coffee."
1330,5.0,Great hotel right in the middle of the strip!,"We enjoyed our stay at Bellagio hotel Las Vegas. We liked that a real person speaks to you in the registration. In Ceasar’s Palace we had to do the check-in through their Express machine so that took a bit more time to figure it out, since the registration people were not very accomodating and limited in staffing. After check-in, we proceeded to find our room, which was confusing at first since you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators. But after maybe 2 elevator trips we were better with our directions. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated with the mesmerizing Chihuly blown-glass installation and so classy. The Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens is also a must see and it’s free! Four times a year, for every season, it changes its display to"
1331,5.0,Best vacation ever,"Beautiful resort. Friendly ,accommodating & knowledgeable staff. Clean room. Prompt and delicious in- room dining. First time massage, I look forward to future massages. We dined at Noodles restaurant and it was great. Snacks is a great pace too for a casual bite to eat.Valet service is very prompt & detail oriented."
1332,2.0,A Fading Icon On The Strip,"What was once a beacon of Vegas for it’s stellar level of service has succumb to an untrained, careless staff that has ruined the five diamond reputation it once had. Enjoy the fountains but stay elsewhere if you want actual high-end service."
1333,5.0,Beautiful place.,The hotel was decorated beautifully for the season. Room was very clean and comfortable. The amenities were awesome and all you could ask for. The fountain show was amazing and mesmerizing. I loved my four day visit and plan to return soon!!
1334,5.0,Bellagio,"Great experience. Recommend planning your dining preferences in advance… big demand for fine dining. Lots of options… just plan prior to arrival. Bedding is a little soft, The lighting could be better by the bed."
1335,5.0,Vegas,Highly recommend Bellagio! Best place on the strip. Location is perfect. Staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurants were very good. Make reservations before you get here. There are so many people. We enjoyed this visit.
1336,5.0,Definitely the Best 5+ Hotel and Casino in Vegas!!,"Beautiful hotel, gorgeous rooms and views, perfect location, excellent restaurants and top notch customer service! We have stayed at most of the top hotels and find the Bellagio meets all of our needs…we love it!! We are pretty much hotel snobs so you can totally trust this honest review!"
1337,5.0,Excellent,"Best hotel in Vegas. Location couldn’t be better. The whole place is wonderful. Except for the lady at the front desk. The rest of the staff is exceptional. Buffet is amazing. Room service is very good, but they take too long. Will definitely go back."
1338,4.0,Beautiful but overpriced,"The building is beautiful, but eating options are limited and very expensive, especially for breakfast. The number and variety of slot machines was disappointing. The spa was good. I hope that COVID 19 staffing issues will resolve some of these negatives if we ever get past the pandemic."
1339,5.0,A must stay when on Vegas,"If you had to choose out of all the locations in Vegas, Bellagio is the one. From guest experience, location, event services…this team will deliver.The Bellagio is well represented for a reason. And once you are there, you will quickly see why. This was one of many events we have held here. And we will and do continue to come back."
1340,2.0,Old and Sad,"The rooms are so outdated. We had a salon suite and upon check in our bathroom lights were not working, sink was clogged up, toilet making strange noises, and windows very dirty. Strange room service- we ordered coffee and tea one morning and they were brought in boxes! Housekeeping was poor and left the boxes our entire stay. The hairdryer and clock in the room must have been 15 years old. The room felt dirty and the pillows were cheap and terrible. I would only recommend Bellagio for its spa and location."
1341,2.0,Poor,I was not at all impressed with the state. I feel as if the price was way too much in my room was absolutely disgusting. The only thing I paid for was location which was great. I would not recommend this to anybody it is all about the name and I will not be coming back to this establishment
1342,3.0,Not What it Used to Be,The Bellagio needs updating. The room was outdated. It had stains on the rug and mold around the shower. No water pressure at all and no tissues. That was weird. Room service came in plastic and cardboard with cheap plastic utensils. Ordered soup and didn't even get a soup spoon. It was packed so the Bellagio isn't hurting.
1343,2.0,Didn’t meet expectations,"On arrival the bathroom lights stopped working. Even though we called immediately, maintenance did not arrive for 2 hours to fix it. We paid an extra $60 for late check out and housekeeping knocked and tried entering 3 times even though late checkout was guaranteed until 3pm and we kept telling each person that our ride was coming at 2:45pm. We ordered room service and they omitted items from the order. One order was steak and it arrived on a soggy paper plate, with nothing else to cut it on. Overall, paid $600 for one night and $100 for room service. With this experience, save your money and go to the Venetian."
1344,5.0,Vegas Fall Trip,Love the Bellagio! Stayed in a suite this trip and was on 31st floor of spa tower. Now we are ruined as this room will be hard to top! Already planning a spring trip…till next time Beautiful Bellagio!
1345,3.0,Disappointed w/Service,"Check-in staff was not very friendly, he just gave us our room keys and told us how to get to the room. We were not told to enjoy our stay and upon checking out was not asked if we enjoyed our stay. Upon entry into room the telephone did not work, and we had to purchase ice for insulin storage because ice machine was empty. Room was adequate, nice marble bathroom but room did not compare to the Venetian Hotel or Four Seasons."
1346,3.0,Mixed Feelings :/,"I’ve been going to MGM Resorts for overs 10 years and lucky enough to stay 3-4 times a year. MLife has taken good care of us :-) This was our first time at Bellagio ( we usually stay at Aria) First off, our room was not cleaned properly, (we were staying in a StayWell room) food and clothing left in the drawers, our bathroom was not cleaned, stickers on the shower wall, a hanger was right smack in the middle of the curtain rod. Anyway, we addressed to the front desk, we got a few vouchers for the inconvenience and we moved on. They are quite quick on the vouchers but do they really access with the staff? I was told that unless I ask for housekeeping they just don’t come?! That I found bizarre, I was told from Housekeeping that we had to call and ask. « I was like, aren’t"
1347,4.0,Nice property,Wayfair excellent restaurant the casino was nice. O show the best in Las Vegas I did not like the fact that there is no food in the whole casino and hotel except room service. Need to have a good court with hot dogs and burgers for late night eating.
1348,5.0,The amazing hotel,The most amazing hotel the service was excellent the Beaty of this hotel it’s incredible Kim at the front desk always very informative soo nice to see everyone always on the point Thank you the location it’s perfect
1349,5.0,Best Luxury Hotel on Strip,Best Hotel for all age couples wanting to have great time in a luxury hotel with VIP service. Service from Casino are great and always making sure you are ha Ing a great time. Restaurants are from snacks to top in house (who are also some of the best in Vegas) are delicious with great service.
1350,5.0,Premier Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip,"Yes, a true 5 star property. Beautifully decorated hotel inside and out. Outside, you have the large lake with the dancing fountains. Great water shows in the evening. Love to watch them, and we watched for several hours over our 2 night stay. Wonderfully landscaped. The inside is so very clean and upscale. Marble floors everywhere, ceiling of the Italian glass in flowers, conservatory with amazing flowers and animal characters. Really nice. Nice location also as you are directly across from the Paris Casino with its Eiffel Tower. Great photo spots overlooking the lake. Our room was sparkling clean. With the new MGM app, we did not have to go to the front desk at all during our stay. You get a digital key on your phone and when the room is ready, the message came that"
1351,5.0,Nice stay at a timelessly elegant property,"I did a mobile check-in and my room was ready at noon. I did not need to check in before that, but it was nice to know it was ready. I used the digital key so there was no need to check-in in person. I love the rooms as they are spacious and clean."
1352,5.0,Another wonderful Stay,The Bellagio is such a beautiful property. We stayed at one of the newly renovated Stay Well rooms with a fountain view. We enjoyed the fountain show and a great view of the strip. The staff is courteous and helpful. The buffet was delicious and in spite of the price worth the money as the food is of great quality.
1353,3.0,Overrated and Overpriced,Yes. The Bellagio appears lovely. But you will be nickeled and dimed at every turn. Black Jack dealers were very uninterested in the guests. The drinks are ridiculously expensive as is the food. Late night dining is simply unavailable unless you leave the hotel.
1354,5.0,Great time,"Had an amazing time, only one hiccup and was fixed right away. Room service, buffet was amazing and house keeping was exceptional. The stay was very relaxing and did not feel bother or any inconvenience what so ever"
1355,3.0,Overpriced,Value is not there for price paid. Restaurants are way overpriced most of which had very limited selection so difficult to find something really like for that price. Need broader range of different prices restaurants. Mobile check-in process was also a failure. I tried more than 10 times but it kept saying “can’t generate code” so I could even get elevator to my floor and needed to have first security person help. Then didn’t work at my door so needed to find 2nd security person who let me in but said he knew nothing about technology so he couldn’t help. So I had to call front desk to get physical keys. After a long day of travel not what I wanted to have to spend 30 minted dealing with.
1356,5.0,Return to Bellagio,"Exceptional service at front desk. Convenient to see wonderful show. Located centrally for me to walk several casinos without difficulty. Has a tram for Aria,Vdara, Park MGM and Crystal shops. Fountain view room with music on tv to enjoy full fountain shows in comfortable setting"
1357,5.0,Great Value in Vegas,Was in Vegas for a wedding. Got a great rate based on the bridal block. Bellagio does not disappoint. Room was clean and modern. Wish the restaurants did not close at 3 and re-open at dinner. Check in lines are long. You need more staff. Wish you could do something about the resort fee......
1358,3.0,Criminal room charges,The hotel is nice but everything is a far walk down to lobby so they trap you and charge you $22 per fiji water in the room. By the way no where does it say they are not complimentary and no where is there a price. $132 for 6 small bottles of Fiji water. Should be illegal to not list the price if they aren’t free.
1359,1.0,Bellagio Not All That Thanks to Upkeep and Housekeeping,"Checked us into a room with soiled towels in the bathroom and used bars of soap in the shower. After being moved to a new room, on Sunday, housekeeping the waste, from trash can in the restroom, in the toilet…including the latex gloves they wear when cleaning BUT they forgot to flush the toilet. In the Fountain Tower, on the 7th floor, the wall paper is peeling off the wall and they even used masking tape to hold it together. A supervisor from housekeeping said they have been reporting that issue to management for months and it still has not been rectified."
1360,4.0,A great stay in Vegas,I had a wonderful time. Everything was central to what our interest was. Food option were ok. But breakfast option were limited unless we went to the buffet. However the food at the buffet was great. Shopping was also good.
1361,5.0,Only place to stay!,I’ve stayed at most Vegas resorts and The Bellagio is by far the best! When we arrived the check in was nice and smooth. The front desk employees were excellent. The room was spectacular. We only had a standard room I can’t wait to get a suite next trip. The bed was so comfortable. The gaming was good and The poker room was excellent. They comped our stay which made it a perfect trip.
1362,1.0,Never use the mgm app!,"I checked in around noon or so using the mgm app. It automatically assigned me a room. I arrived later that evening and discovered that I was given a room on the 4th floor looking at a cement wall and a vast cement rooftop. I made numerous calls the next morning, but not before spending an angry night in a disgraceful room. I was given a different room the next day. My advice is to NEVER check in with the corporate app- it’ll steal your money and ruin your stay!"
1363,5.0,Bellagio is about excellence and luxury,"My husband and I have been staying at the Bellagio for more than five years, twice a year to celebrate our birthdays. The Bellagio is about excellence and luxury.. the exceptional and very welcoming staff, the salon suite overlooking the iconic Bellagio dancing fountain, fine dining with staff who are exceptionally friendly and personable making the dining memorable, the loosest slots in Las Vegas."
1364,1.0,"Overpriced, construction and dirty","Room had molding food in fridge, pool while open had a jackhammer going all 3 days straight (not relaxing at all), we given wrong room type at check-in because not enough rooms but they were obviously not full. Most restaurants in side were always closed every day and the few open had private events on the fountain side. Generally, wayyyy overpriced for the generic room and would stay anywhere else next time."
1365,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,"All staff throughout the hotel were pleasant, helpful and friendly. The beds and pillows were so comfy! Our room was very clean as was the entire hotel. Beautifully decorated and there’s 20 restaurants to choose from. My favorite was Sadelle’s which has the best French toast that I have ever had!"
1366,5.0,Vegas,"Hotel and all it has to offer is amazing! Location was perfect. Fountain show live up to it expectation. Pricing on food was higher than expected. Room service was very pricey as well. Staff was very helpful, friendly and present. Wonderful luxury room."
1367,4.0,Birthday trip,Only complaint is there wasn’t enough waiters in the casino to service drinks. At smaller casinos in Alabama you’re able to use touch screen and order a drink. With the price tag on the stay it should more waiters and an update the a lot machines
1368,5.0,Bellagio did not disappoint,"After reading other reviews before our stay, I was hesitant that I chose a good hotel/resort. It was great! Check in was a breeze, friendly service. I asked for a ""renovated"" room as suggested. We were placed in a newer room, no noise from the outside/elevator traffic, etc. Gambling was great. Mainly a few slots, poker & black jack. Dealers were all friendly & helpful. Centrally located, which was perfect for some exercise & not too far walking. Spago restaurant was amazing!! No complaints here!"
1369,4.0,Great hotel and casino. Just wish I had king bed for night 1,"Bellagio is top notch. Comfortable, great location, fountain show is great and restaurants are very good. Just wish the king bed room I reserved was available night one. Got it night 2. They were able to resolve it next day."
1370,5.0,Great 50th birthday,"At check in, I got a rose and chocolates, and asked for a fountain view. We had a very nice view, and enjoyed watching the fountains to the music from our room. It is nice that the check in desk is close to the self park entrance."
1371,5.0,One of the Best on Strip,"Bellagio has one of the best locations, best staff, terrific restaurants. It's pricey but worth it. I have always enjoyed staying there and still do. Pro-tip: Walk across to CVS and get some bottled water for the trip as opposed to paying the in-room price."
1372,5.0,Beautiful place,"I’ve stayed in Vegas before but this is the first time at the Bellagio and I can honestly say the only reason I’ll be back to Vegas is if i stay here again lol. Has all the shopping, restaurants I could look for and great ventilation so it doesn’t smell strong like cigarettes."
1373,3.0,Bellagio During Asian New Year 2021,"We had a great time during our January and February Bellagio stays. However, we do not know how simple things like cobwebs, rotting wood, and water-soaked areas of carpet (that emanated a foul odor, which was covered up by some scented freshener) can pass inspection for guest use in their suites. I guess sometimes you got to overlook the little things even in an iconic resort."
1374,5.0,Already booked another stay,"My wife and I have gone to Vegas every October for the last 7 years (minus last year due to COVID-19). We are from Northern Canada so we try to stay at least 7-10 days. This was our first time at the Bellagio and hands down has been our best experience. We stayed in a Stay Well room which I highly recommend. Our room was immaculate every day we were there. We have stayed at several other hotels on the strip and nothing compares to the Bellagio. The check in process was quick and easy, the M-life Manager was awesome (helped us load up comps), pool was amazing and our waitress was so polite and genuine. I can rave about all of the positives but instead all I can say is “We have found our home away from home!” We already booked another stay at the Bellagio over Christmas. Can’t"
1375,5.0,refreshing,stay was great staff was great we stayed only one night but it was good the o show was great as always we had a great time as always pit boss was friendly when we played the staff was also friendly would stay again
1376,4.0,My FAV: Bellagio,"We travel to California often and always manage to fit in a return trip to Vegas. We have stayed in many resorts and my resort of preference is still The Bellagio. Things have changed with covid so it would be unfair to complain about our recent visit. Normally I would give5 stars but we had two issues: restaurant hours are not what they used to be and I never had to make a res for breakfast! Probably bc room service delivery was CRAZY...NOT SURE WHAT CAME FIRST THERE THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG. It is also my favorite place to gamble, but the stakes were upped to $25 min at the tables. Tables were limited perhaps due to available personnel (many of whom I have known for years, missed and hope are well) but it would have been nice to see a few $15 tables in all genres. Some"
1377,4.0,"Had a great weekend, everything was awesome.","Had a great weekend, everything was awesome. Hands-down The best MGM property to stay at. Amazing restaurants, great bars and a lot of action at the tables. Very well controlled environment even through Covid."
1378,5.0,Awesome Hotel and Staff,"Another wonderful experience at Bellagio. Will not stay anywhere else when this hotel offers comfort, beauty, first class accommodations, kind staff - luxury for me. I have had the pleasure of visiting Las Vegas for many years, stayed at many hotels. Bellagio is wonderful, clean, great food and service. Cabaret Dinner is wonderful. Sports center is awesome. Buy my Super Bowl tickets there every year. Always look forward to my stay at Bellagio."
1379,5.0,A solicited trip to Las Vegas,All was very enjoyed during our stay. The only challange I experienced is trying to get coffee in the morning and having to wait 45 minutes in line. There has to be a better way. Also trying to get into Sadelles for breakfast was also very challenging and we just gave up when trying to make an appointment.
1380,1.0,Unsafe COVID environment,"There is no enforcement of COVID protocols at all. Less than 50% of most guests are unmasked in conference center, casino and elevators with no staff having any visible concern for this. I ended up not attending conference sessions because the rooms were set up with chairs attached to each other but no one making sure anyone was wearing a mask. In addition, I paid more to stay on a Stay Well flor and it was clear the room had not been cleaned completely. The robe had a brown substance all over it (not old stains - I'm not sure I want to know of what), the bath mat had black oil-like stains on it and the shower door wouldn't close so the bathroom floor couldn't really be kept dry."
1381,5.0,Bellagio rating by Frost,From the check in to tables my experience was superb. I had zero issues with my room and enjoyed the water show from my window. I’m excited to come back and stay on the property as well as recommend it to friends and family
1382,5.0,Fantastic trip to Las Vegas,"Bellagio is one of the most outstanding hotels that I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The employees, dealers, customer service reps, and casino hosts are friendly, professional, and very respectful. They make you feel like your always welcomt there. The restaurants are phenomenal with a wide array of delicious foods to choose from. The show was great!!!!"
1383,5.0,Best hotel in Vegas,The Bellagio Hotel & Casino was the best ever to stay and play at!! The restaurant was wonderful and the coffee shop was fantastic! The personnel was very polite and courteous!! I would stay again just to see the view of fountain again!!! I give this Casino and Hotel a 10 plus!! Thank you again!!
1384,5.0,Excellent!,"Love, love, love the Bellagio. I have stayed there 4-5 times and love every minute. The restaurants have gotten a little pricey but the food is delicious. The rooms are very nice and the views, rather facing the strip or the swimming pools are beautiful."
1385,5.0,Couldn’t be better,It was a short time here but the two days were very relaxing and well worth it. Staff was extremely friendly and all the services were as expected. Now the wife wants to move here. I’m sure going to miss her.
1386,3.0,Noisy Fountain View,"On our recent stay I reserved a fountain view room. While the view was beautiful both during the day and at night, the noise of the street and music late into the morning hours made it hard to sleep. The high priced gambling tables are also disappointing as we had to leave the hotel to find tables we could afford to play at."
1387,5.0,Best Resort in Las Vegas,The Bellagio offers the best service in Las Vegas along with top restaurants and great stores for your spouse to shop! The hotel rooms are all updated and very clean. We have never complained over the last 15 years at the Bellagio!
1388,5.0,Oct Vega Get Away,Loved our visit. Bell desk was super helpful. Enjoyed dining at several hotel restaurants. Food was always delicious and the service was wonderful. Everyone at the Bellagio was friendly and courteous. It’s our favorite hotel on the Strip.
1389,5.0,The Vegas Strip in Style,The Bellagio gets the thumbs up for the free entertainment (fountains & atrium gardens) and friendly staff (kudos to the bell hop team for wearing a smile). The rooms were clean and overall experience favorable.
1390,5.0,Never forget this year,"We had a faboulous time with sisters on my birthday , the pool and weather was great It was bit crowded in pool area but nice place to relax and play slots my sister was very impress with my room newly renovated"
1391,5.0,Bellagio was great,We love the location of Bellagio as it is within easy walking distance of the main strip area. The service was outstanding and the room was excellent. We love the fountain shows and the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. Bellagio is pricier but we feel that it is well worth it.
1392,5.0,Still a Classic !!,"Don’t let all the petty reviews scare you about The Bellagio. I consider myself a hotel snob and I’ve stayed at all the nice resorts on the strip, including Bellagio, many times. Bellagio is still a great classic. We were doing guys football trip and upgraded to a queen suite in the spa tower. Yes some of the stuff like the lightswitch covers look a little dated but if you’re focused on that on vacation you need to chill out. There are 3 bathrooms in this suite, which we loved with 3 guys in the room. The separate living room also gave us more space. The walk to the casino is a bit far but the walk from the spa tower elevators to Aria back door through Vdara took me 4 minutes. Don’t use the slow tram unless you want to walk through Crystals mall. The Gym is phenomenal and"
1393,5.0,Vacation,The views are beautiful. To the pool that is gorgeous and romantic. The entire hotel is stunning and first class all around. 5 star doesent say enough about this hotel. It has to be the best of the best of hotels. World class.
1394,5.0,Vacation,The views are beautiful. To the pool that is gorgeous and romantic. The entire hotel is stunning and first class all around. 5 star doesent say enough about this hotel. It has to be the best of the best of hotels. World class.
1395,1.0,Bellagio is old and tired,I paid a premium for a “newly renovated” room but when we went to take a shower we had low water pressure (which is so ironic) and no hot water. The tile floor was also dirty and had coffee stains all over it.
1396,5.0,Just the perfect size casino hotel.,"We always feel at home at Bellagio. Some Casino Hotels are huge and we always get lost looking for things. The entire staff in all departments is friendly and very helpful. The restaurants are great but make reservations before you arrive as many are pretty booked. This location has bridges and trams to other Hotels, it’s so easy to get around."
1397,5.0,Enjoyed our stay,"We've been to Vegas numerous times and this is the first time staying at Bellagio. We thought it was going to be an inconvenient location but we ended up loving it. The only downfall is we stayed in the Spa Tower, which is all the way in the back of the hotel. Way too far for our liking. Also the shower head was awful it was basically like a ring of water, everything in the middle was dry. Other than that the staff, restaurants and gaming was all great!"
1398,3.0,Bellagio,The queen suite we stayed in looked old and dated. The phones were old and some were inoperable. There were not enough electric sockets to power our devices. I was not impressed by my steak at Prime. I thought the steak and service was better at SW at the Wynn.
1399,5.0,A solicited trip to Las Vegas,We were approached by the property to stay 4 nights courtesy of the Bellagio Hotel. Food and play credits were also offered. We went with a great deal that was offered and really enjoyed our time spent there. Unfortunately getting coffee was a real challenge as the wait was 45 minutes and all I wanted was coffee. A seperate line shout be
1400,3.0,Not a good stay,"The hotel is nice, however our suite was dated, wallpaper peeling everywhere, curtain for men's bathroom was stuck all the way up, the ladies bathroom door locks automatically, so we left it open the entire stay. The dust was extremely bad (we have pictures). The in room dining took forever (2 hours for a box of coffee with stale muffins). We have been staying at Bellagio in the Cypress Suite for 10+ years. This was by far the worst stay."
1401,3.0,Weekend trip,Overall my stay was OK but our host was very rude(Ann-Maria). And our hotel room there was a dirty sock left in there from the prior guest and a half Eaten snicker bar in the fridge. Will not be staying here next time
1402,2.0,Time to Step It Up,"The Bellagio is a beautiful property. Unfortunately, our room had unrepaired ceiling repairs, the windows to the fountain view were filthy, and the technology if getting very dated. The room that we had was an upgraded fountain view. It was very load when people were in the hallway as well as noise from the strip. The common areas were very nice, but the property was booked to capacity and the staff was not ready. Be sure to book any dinning far in advanced if you are not a VIP, otherwise plan on eating off site or waiting in long lines at snack bars."
1403,2.0,A get away,For the cost to stay at this hotel casino one would think that you would be greeted and explained the benefits of the place. A brief orientation or something would have been nice. No one even contacted us to say welcome to the Bellagio
1404,4.0,Customer Service Needs Refresh,"There was very little staff except by the pool, and it felt like I was expected to already know, seek out an employee and had to ask for everything. No services, reservations or tickets were suggested. Restaurant staff were dirty and brought wrong food and missing items."
1405,4.0,None,"They stay was alright, but didn’t seem exceptional. I’ve stayed at this property many times. This trip seemed a little less of the experience that I’ve had before. Truly no complaints, but nothing stood out any differently from other properties that are of typical less quality. Yellowtail’s food could’ve been better for the price paid."
1406,4.0,Nice and clean,"The Bellagio is a very nice hotel, offering everything needed for an awesome vacay. There’s everything here, you really don’t have to leave the hotel. The staff is really nice and knowledgeable! We will be returning annually!"
1407,2.0,"Not the Bellagio, I heard about","Dirty rooms, including previous guests hair in my shower. Plus the shower constantly drips unless you super tighten the handle seriously look at it in room 19-089. Disappointed overall with guest services in room dinning was to be 70 mins turned into over 90mins then to have things missing from the order? There are no in room coffee makers? Nespresso is a bare min today at $150 a night hotels?? Plus no cleaning service after the first night,"
1408,5.0,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel location is wonderful. We had a lovely stay. I would definitely come back. The hotel provides a refrigerator for the room upon request at no additional cost. The beds are very comfortable, and there were always plenty of towels."
1409,4.0,Another great experience at the Bellagio,"Great time as always! Good staff, top notch location, great restaurants. Just wish I had more luck at the tables ;) Would go back there again during the spring/summer to enjoy the pool for more time!…"
1410,5.0,Best place in Vegas,I’ve been to Vegas around 10 times and this is by far the best stay that I’ve ever had. the Bellagio was exceptional in every way and I highly recommend them. Aaron Wynn arranged an amazing stay so ask for him if you want top-notch service.
1411,5.0,5 star experience at Bellagio!,"Bellagio lived up to our expectations. Well Stay room was beautifully appointed and smoke free! Restaurants and bars provided excellent experiences. Staff, with rare exception, was well-trained, pleasant and helpful."
1412,5.0,Best Hotel in Las Vegas,"The beauty of Bellagio is incomparable, the fountain water show is magnificent. On line check-in and check-out is very efficient. Beautiful pool. The stay well premier room is incredible, the concept, the memory foram matress, many ammenities and air purification really works. Highly recommended."
1413,2.0,Not up to their own standards,"I have stayed here many times before. Now the staff was not friendly, except the concierge. Housekeeping called me at 12:15 in the morning to make sure I didn’t wanna have my room done up after 1215 which is what we requested for the next day in the afternoon. Check-in was a disaster, the TV in the room was broken. And the room was old."
1414,1.0,$50 Tables!,"I was at the Bellagio this past weekend and despite the hotel being lovely as usual, I stay at the Bellagio to play craps. The usual slate of tables offered in the past ran the full gamut from $15 to $500, with a good mix. However, this most recent trip, over the course of 4 days, I saw exactly one $25 table, at 7:30 am on a Friday morning, and then it promptly got bumped to $50 at 8:00 am! The rest of my 4 days were a mix of $50, $100, $200, and $500 tables! If they can get that kind of action, then more power to them, but the tables were very poorly attended, yet they would not move down the minimum. I have zero issue with the Bellagio making all the money they can, but this was an abrupt change that will price me out of that hotel!"
1415,3.0,Go to Luxor,"Clumps of hair in the shower drain.Wallpaper peeling.Used shampoo.Not happy.May as well have stayed at the luxor.I had a cleaner,nicer room there with the same furnature.Youll save a lot of money and have more to do."
1416,5.0,Bellagio Las Vegas.. Amazing from A to Z,"I recently stayed at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. The hotel accommodations were beyond what I expected. With the covid virus being a concern, they put any concerns I had to rest. Although masks are required for everyone's safety, it was implemented in such a smooth fashion that it did not detract from the enjoyment at any given time. In my haste to check out, I forgot an item in my room. Melody, who is in lost and found, was incredible. My item was found, arrangements were made to ship it back to me.. it was .. an Amazing trip from A to Z!"
1417,3.0,Nice but could be better,Poor game selection - not enough of the older classic penny slots. No Corona Premiere. Way too far to walk to guest rooms - was worn out on vacation - not good. No food comps at checkout. And very tight slots.
1418,5.0,Friendly staff and wonderful room,"We requested a room with a view overlooking the fountains. That is exactly what we got. It was mesmerizing to see them from above instead of at street level. From the men outside assisting with cars and luggage, to the front desk, to the housekeeping staff, everybody was friendly and helpful."
1419,4.0,Great Place!,"Great facilities - very clean. Friendly, amazing staff. Awesome atmosphere. Breakfast room service was great. Highly recommend for those looking for a wonderful place to stay in Las Vegas. I will definitely be returning!"
1420,3.0,Disappointed,Had made reservations six months in advance and asked repeatedly for early check in none was available.. Went to VIP check-in. There were only two attendees for several people. And Picasso restaurant canceled reservations less than a week before I was to have my 50th birthday dinner.
1421,5.0,Vegas get-away,"Had wonderful time, only concern was that it was hard to get reservations at the dining sites at times and places we wanted to go for food. Also some of the venues were not open. Didn't want to leave the Bellagio for other casinos or restaurants due to covid. Happy that mask mandate is in place for this environment."
1422,1.0,Dirty Underwear from Previous guest,"Our shower drain was clogged, they never delivered the mini fridge to store our medical supplies and to top it off we found dirty underwear from the previous guest on top of the closet. Nights were pretty loud, you can hear all the street noice from the strip, but I guess that’s Vegas."
1423,1.0,Terrible,Terrible I order a suit with two king Beds and a fountain view and I did not get either of them and check in was at 4pm And you guys do not have my room ready to 6 pm And I had reserved the room at least a month in advance
1424,5.0,The best hotel in Vegas,"Having stayed at many of the hotels in Vegas and obviously visiting other hotels, I wouldn’t have stayed at ANY other hotel. The staff are incredible. Walk over to the Cromwell (I think 4 star) and you will get an eye roll if you ask for the restroom location. Walked to Ceasars and the decor / casino is definitely outdated and not as nice as the Bellagio. I could go on. I’m very impressed"
1425,4.0,It was nice,"All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had an issue with our shower in our room. There was hardly any pressure. A day after we checked out my wife’s credit card was randomly charged. We have no idea why because she only used her card to purchase food, but the charge was from the front desk."
1426,1.0,Changed the point system,"Changed their point system on the player card. Use to take $300 to get 100 points in keno, now it takes $800 to earn the same 100 points When I go to Vegas, I also hope to win, but in reality I know I am not going to win. I do not get upset when I lose, I do however like to feel like I am getting some kind of value for the money I spend. Not so much this trip. I inquired about the changes was told keno is suppose to be like poker machines. I understand poker machines needing more money in to earn points-due to the fact if a person plays excellent poker, they increase their odds of winning. This is NOT the case for keno, their is no way to increase your odds with keno. It is strictly like a slot-you can’t increase your odds with expert play. MGM seems to have lost sight of"
1427,2.0,LOUD room,"We booked a corner room on the 19th floor, fountain/strip view. The room was lovely (albeit the couch was missing the back cushions, not throw pillows, the actual back cushions), but the room literally shook until 4am with the music from a local nightclub. We were miserable. I would never stay here again. We didn’t get to sleep until after the club closed, and Bellagio would not honor our Amex Platinum 4pm check out, even though we paid with Amex, because we didn’t book through the Amex site. It was a petty reason, and reflected poorly on the customer service."
1428,4.0,Booking issue,"I booked 2 nights, they claimed only 1. So wanted to make sure I had a 2nd night and they wanted 500.00. I hoped to work out a better deal, but they had no interest in working it out. So was comped at another casino"
1429,2.0,Poor service,"I reserved on Expedia, and when we arrived they told us they were overbooked, so didn't have a premier king room for us. We were woken up by maintenance trying to come in our room at 2am. They said they needed to see if our bathroom had power, due to a leak above us."
1430,2.0,Not Spectacular for the price. Wynn is better hotel,"Room was average, and over priced. Service at Slidell’s was a slow and irritating. Gambler 500.00 …. No cocktail service. Will chose a different location next visit. I visit Vegas 5+ a year, both business and pleasure."
1431,5.0,Bellagio is the only place to stay!,"This hotel is absolutely amazing! It feels like you are in a magical place. It's extremely clean and well lit. Employees are everywhere but unassuming. They are very helpful and eager to answer your questions. They all are friendly, courteous and smiling. The suites are beautiful! The Spa tower is exclusive and you feel exclusive when asked to show your room key to even get on the elevator. The room is very spacious, and the beds are soooo comfortable. The bathroom is huge! The location is perfect and you can watch the fountains from your room!"
1432,5.0,Bellagio,"We had a wonderful trip! I would recommend Bellagio to everyone. The best hotel on the strip. Been staying there for over 20 years! All the restaurants are great. Oh, you have to try the Hotdog st Snacks! The best."
1433,5.0,Old but beautiful location.,"The hotel was beautiful..old world charm. The location was perfect..centrally located. I did find that we were priced gouged..I was charged 5.36 for a 20 ounce Diet Coke from one of the shops and parking should have been free for guests. Every time we left to explore, it costs us 18.00 to park. That was outrageous in my opinion. Also, I was annoyed with the housekeeping staff. They came in twice without authorization. We had the do not disturb sign on the door."
1434,5.0,Best hotel,Everyone was great and had no problems what so ever.Rooms we’re clean beds were comfortable and staff was very helpful and had answers for any questions we had. I will be recommending this hotel and will be returning every time I go to Las Vegas
1435,4.0,Room with a View,Nice room amazing view of the fountains. The Bellagio is always clean and elegant. Our meal at Spago was outstanding. The manager for our private event was very accommodating to our party and made our evening extra special.
1436,3.0,Bellagio - Las Vegas,Casino hotels should be avoided by non-smokers - unless/until they ban indoor smoking. $150 per night is held on your credit card when you check in and is not removed on the day of departure. No coffee maker in the room. Neither sink stopper worked. Fairly poor water pressure in the shower. / I expect more from a luxury hotel.
1437,5.0,Beautiful,The hotel was beautiful. The botanical garden in the hotel was amazing. The beds in the hotel were nice and soft which made them wonderful to sleep in. The cost of the room was way over priced considering it was a typical hotel room. The room was nothing special just your standard 2 bed room with way over priced mini bar.
1438,3.0,Ehh on the Bellagio,"We were not super impressed with the Bellagio for the price. We were super excited to complete our stay in Las Vegas with the treat of staying at the Bellagio and it wasn't the greatest. Maybe we just aren't accustomed to how busy the hotel is, but this was crazy. There was no one to help self check in, our room was all the way on the other side of the tower and no could give us proper directions, our digital key didn't work at first and we had to have the concierge print us plastic ones and getting a hold of anyone at the Bell desk was impossible. The bathroom in our room needed help as well. Overall, we were bummed this wasn't nicer for the huge price tag."
1439,3.0,It was a nice room,the room was average. the room service very limited on what you can order. Also the room service kept missing items and had to call them again to bring the items and the food was cold by the time we received them
1440,4.0,Beautiful hotel,Hotel was very beautiful. Our room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Do not pick up any beverages stocked in the rooms refrigerator unless you plan to drink it! We were charged over $80 tax just for picking up a bottle liquor from the fridge that we did not open or drink. So beware the airplane size bottles of liquor which were around $22 in addition to the $80 plus tax they charge you. Was told the fee would be removed once they verified we did not open anything. Have not received credit card statement yet to verify. This was our first trip to Vegas and everything was this Expensive! Vegas is checked off our bucket list and I don’t think we will go back.
1441,5.0,Memorable trip!,"The Bellagio had a big part in making our Halloween weekend memorable, this was my bf's first time in Vegas and he absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Bellagio, we had no problems and the aesthetic is breathtaking."
1442,5.0,Great Accommodations,The room was immaculate and obviously recently updated. Being in the middle of a pandemic made cleanliness a primary concern. The giant shower provided a wonderful end to each day. I will definitely choose to stay here the next time I visit Las Vegas.
1443,5.0,Wonderful experience,Room was great. Strip view means you are in far tower not main building. Most likely view of parking garage along with strip view and limited fountain view. Bed and pillows super comfy. Conservatory beautiful as always and smelled amazing for fall. Limited quick service type meals like at other Mlife resorts. Plenty of nice restaurants that open later and need reservations. Over all great relaxing stay. Online check in a breeze and room was ready early.
1444,3.0,Wasn’t as good as our first stay,"Haven’t been to the Bellagio since 2015. We didn’t receive great service so we have been staying at other properties. Decided to give Bellagio another try because they had a decent price for our time frame. Stains on the sheets, missing remote control, dust everywhere in the room. Overall this was a less than spectacular stay and we probably won’t be back."
1445,1.0,"Overrated , over crowded","Bellagio was cool maybe 20 years ago , it’s definitely lost its luster , traffic both pedestrian and vehicular outside the hotel is god awful. You can barely pull into the driveway without pedestrians jumping into the street from all directions. Check in was not good , at 5pm our room still wasn’t ready and the front desk couldn’t be bothered to comp something for the inconvenience. Tried to play poker in the very small and outdated poker room and all of the hosts were rude or short tempered for seemingly no reason, maybe don’t work as a poker host if you can’t handle the job its not exactly a challenging or difficult job. Visited other poker rooms on the strip and compared to others Bellagio is the bottom of the barrel. Next time I’m in Vegas I’ll either stay at the Aria or the"
1446,1.0,Overpriced with poor customer service,"Do not expect a coffee pot or refrigerator you can use in hotel room. If you get moved to a different room, do not expect that room to be thoroughly cleaned and check to ensure beverages weren’t already missing, hence an added expense to your bill"
1447,3.0,Bellagio may be slipping…,"Room was dated. Not nearly as nice as RW Conrad, Palazzo, or even Vdara. I feel like the Bellagio is struggling to keep up with the newer, more tech advanced properties. Definitely not the Bellagio I remember from years past."
1448,1.0,Hell Hole,"A room that should have been a non- smoking, smelled more like smoke than a chimney. Brought it up to staff attention, but nothing was done. The cost of the suite was over $3,000.00 !!!! & it’s too bad staff doesn’t care. Terrible service, EVERYTHING is way too expensive, NO food delivery from restaurants in the hotel/casino. I will definitely NOT be returning to this Hell Hole where you literally waste/ throw your money away. If you’re used to getting decent service, save your self the aggravation & DO NOT stay at this Cheap Hotel/ Casino!!!"
1449,1.0,Terrible place to stay. Unfriendly and disorganized,"Paid $700/ night and the service level was not proportional to cost. Housekeeping decided to clean my room in spite of me asking them not to do so. This is the last time I stay at Belagio. There are many better options and better price. This used to be a good place in its day, but these days are gone. Resturant quality was not that great either."
1450,5.0,First-Class Experience,"The Bellagio lives up to its reputation as a first-class, five-star hotel. he hotel, casino and rooms are very well maintained. The rooms are larger than average size and are tastefully furnished. The fountain experience is breath-taking. The high-end retail stores are a wonderful shopping experience."
1451,3.0,"Not worth it -- beware ""fountain view"" rooms","Booked a room 9 months in advance as an MLife Gold member; booked directly through Bellagio, not a third party agent, and requested a high floor in advance. Was convinced to splurge on a ""Cypress Suite"" because of advertised views of the fountains. When we checked in, we discovered we were on the first floor of rooms. We paid >$1300 for a 180 degree view of the dirty roof (see photo). Staff was completely indifferent -- ""that's the room you're stuck with"". Shockingly poor service for a 5* hotel dealing with an elite rewards member on a cash booking. The lobby was nice."
1452,5.0,Still one of the best hotels in Vegas,This hotel has everything you need and close to all shows and events. Great shows and restaurants. The couples spa with private room is AMAZING!! The hotel staff are all very professional and attentive.
1453,4.0,"Beautiful, world class reputation with minor flaws","Beautiful fountain view room! Chocolate fountain still operating! Main complaint for us was very long checkin line. Then a minor complaint that there was no way to make coffee in our $400+ room. Perhaps this was COVID related, but then would have appreciated access to some way to have complimentary coffee, that even Motel 6 provides! Perhaps it could have been in the lobby or sent by room service upon request."
1454,5.0,Incredible!,"Our stay at the Bellagio was amazing! The service and check in experience was wonderful. All employees were helpful and friendly. The restaurants (Prime, Yellowtail and Spago) were very good. My meal at Prime was one of my best restaurant experiences ever. The fountains are so beautiful. Try to get a room that has a view of the fountains. The swimming pool area is the nicest in Vegas. I will be back soon!"
1455,5.0,Very nice hotel,We found a great rate and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is beautiful. We stayed at the Harrah’s another night. This hotel was so much quieter. Very pretty fall installation in the lobby of the spa tower. Mobile check-in was convenient. Would stay here again.
1456,3.0,Not what expected,"Was booked a king resort room and it was more like a motel room. Not worth the price staff very friendly, hard to gut a reservation at any of the restaurants. Just was not what it was hyped to be. Would not stay again…."
1457,5.0,Perfect ending…,"This was our second stay at the Bellagio. Although I had some reservations about the somewhat lack of enforcement of the Nevada mask mandate compared to other properties, we avoided those unmasked people as best we could. The room was clean and comfortable. The view was great! We gambled in the casino until after 3am on our last night and checked out by 8:30am. Found a couple of slot machines to our liking and it paid off a few hours later."
1458,5.0,Elegant Hitel,Great experience; elegant and airy. Most restaurants in Bellagio and closed early to mid week so we had dinner in our room. Food in the room was very good. Get the fountain view for true enjoyment. Great hotel!
1459,3.0,Windows are dirty so if you get a fountain view be prepared to see the watermarks on the glass. Daily call to housekeepi,"Windows are dirty so if you get a fountain view be prepared to see the watermarks on the glass. Daily call to housekeeping since they dont do that like every other hotel. So before you leave your room you got to call otherwise towels and bed are not made. Slot machines pay poorly, most of the old machines are gone and they are mostly the same type of progressive or regular machines. The only one who seemed to have kept them is Ceasars."
1460,1.0,Vacation turned headache,"I arrived late evening to be told that a fountain room was not available, even though I paid a premium for it. Then the shower in the room they gave me flooded and would not drain. This caused dirty water to sit and accumulate."
1461,3.0,Prepare to pay extra fees,Prepare to pay additional fees when checking in and a resort fee upon checkout. Just another way to charge unnecessary fees for nothing. No complimentary water in the room Figi water in the room was 22.00 a pop. Needless to say we didn’t touch anything! Beds were too soft. I know the thought of a soft bed sounds good but after laying on it for awhile you start to feel like you’re sinking. That’s not good for back support so I didn’t sleep too good during my stay. However it’s a beautiful hotel and accessible to many things in the area.
1462,5.0,Amazing,"Absolutely beautifully appointed room with great view of the fountain. Enjoyed a fantastic show the cirque du soliel. Gaming was fun without breaking the bank. Food at Harvest was the best. Beautiful hotel, bustling with activity and enjoyment. Loved the stay and would not hesitate to return."
1463,2.0,Old Bellagio,"Sorry for the negative review, unfortunately the Bellagio is living off its past grandeur with the fountains and wonderful location on the strip. Unfortunately that’s where it ends it’s pretentious staff and outdated rooms make it second rate. I had a salon strip view suite at an average per night rate of $750. Upon checking in I called front desk to voice my concerns on the dirty outdated room with about 1/2 the lights working which I was told nothing could be done that night and they would get back to me the next morning, and as everyone know no call ever came. So I suffered through this for a total of 4 days then checked in to the sister property Mandalay Bay which was the total opposite, friendly staff great modern clean rooms. Hard to believe it’s under the same MGM"
1464,1.0,Brutal,"Gets worse and worse as this years go on. Once an iconic Vegas hotel. This place is overcrowded it feels like a subway station, terrible service, outdated, casino staff wasn't there. Drinks took 45 minutes at the table, stay well suites say they're upgraded but not."
1465,5.0,Great floor,The floor assigned was great! I loved the bathroom with the walk in shower and the beautiful mirrors. The room was large and could accommodate dinning in the room. Loved the buttons to open/close the drapes.
1466,5.0,When in Vegas it’s got to be at the Bellagio,"You are in the center of the strip convenient to all the right places you want to go to. Fine dining establishments, complete gaming amenities. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and newly refurbished"
1467,2.0,So- so and so big.,"No bellman on check-out for 40 minutes, queues at restaurants- over an hour! Great room, on balance overpriced. Expected so much more. Hype more than quality. Even some pools are banned/selective, room service over 90 minutes too!"
1468,5.0,"Top Notch, beautiful resort!","Not sure why the negative reviews. This resort is gorgeous, top notch, impeccably clean in the rooms and common areas. The rooms are gorgeous. Service by every department and every staff member is TOP NOTCH. The food at the restaurants is amazing along with the service. The security here is amazing as well. I felt very safe, there are security at all the elevators, and no one is allowed up to the rooms without a room key swipe. Also very impressive there strict mask policy and enforcement of it. I was amazed that they were able to get so many people to wear and keep their masks on!"
1469,3.0,Too many added expenses,"Resort fees, taxes, parking, $5+ bottles of water. I know it is Vegas, but basic necessitates like water should not be such a ripoff. The rooms were adequate and the staff is friendly. Great location."
1470,5.0,Great stay,"I had a great time at Bellagio. Went there to celebrate my birthday. I got a room upgrade for being the birthday girl. The lounges are beautiful, food was mouth watering, music was mesmerizing, display & water shown was very intriguing. Highly recommend"
1471,5.0,Luxurious stay,"This property is absolutely beautiful. The amenities are amazing, it’s very clean, not just the corridors but the rooms as well! The beds are extremely comfortable! It was well worth the stay! Will be back in the future!"
1472,2.0,Loud Music from Outside the Hotel.,Was in a room on 28th floor facing the fountain. Was a wonder stay until we were kept up until 3am that cold clearly be heard in our room. Very disappointed with that. My guess many others were as well.
1473,5.0,Made my birthday incredible!,Very clean! Incredible service and the room was amazing! We got a fountain view and loved it. The bed was super comfy! Wish I could bring home the pillows and sheets! Thank you Bellagio! I will be back!
1474,5.0,Great place to stay,Great hotel. room was clean and safe. If you stay there down load app and check in and out with app don’t have to wait in line. Staff is helpful and friendly. The strip view had great view of the fountains and the strip
1475,5.0,Great VACATION!,"The Bellagio is top notch for services. The facility was very clean. Staff was outstanding and very polite. Our room was very clean, large and away from noise. The taxi service was outstanding. The concierge services were great in arranging our tours. Only thing we didn't appreciate was the smokie walk thru the Casino floor to get to the room elevators,. Maybe a separate entrance is needed for us none smokers. Food was good but a little high priced for the quality."
1476,5.0,Gambling getaway,This last trip turned out extremely well. We attended it as a bachelor party . The service was amazing . The gambling was exciting . And the vibes we’re definitely on another level . Will definitely be returning soon to finish gambling !
1477,5.0,Top notch experience,"From the moment we checked in until we left the property we were treated with nothing but exceptional service. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the view can’t be beat. If you’re on the fence about getting fountain view do it. It’s amazing to watch from the comfort of your hotel room. The front desk, Mlife desk, and all of the staff we encountered on property were amazing. They all would go above an beyond to ensure we had the best stay while there."
1478,3.0,Ehhh...,"Room was overpriced, never cooled down after having the thermostat at 60, shower needs some updating. Great shops and casino! The buffet was amazing. Not a ton of places to get coffee in the morning and the place they do have ALWAYS has a long line."
1479,5.0,"beautiful view of fountains, clean room, stay well had air purifier, friendly staff, security checked keys by elevator","Beautiful view, clean room, spacious bathroom in stay well, air purifier was a nice touch, felt safe with security workers by elevators. Enjoyed eating at Snacks, Mayfair, and Saddles in the hotel. Loved room service- prompt & friendly staff served us. All meals were delicious."
1480,5.0,Beautiful Bellagio!,Room was lovely and so comfortable! Great casino. Friendly staff. I can’t recommend this hotel enough. Close to everything on the strip. Only complaint after an amazing stay was there was no milk alternative for coffee on casino floor.
1481,5.0,The Best!,"The Bellagio brings the best of Vegas with a flare of the elegant . The service is impeccable, the restaurants are top notch, and the Cypress pool is a cut above. The Bellagio is an icon and still the gold standard of Vegas resorts."
1482,3.0,We expected more,Our key did not work the first day and never worked letting us out of the parking garage. No one told us about the charges the mini bar would rack up if we moved anything. One can of Coke was teen dollars. Housekeeping left us one towel and then didn’t come one day. Very beautiful hotel. They did give us a food and beverage voucher but still I expected more.
1483,5.0,The best home away from home,"We spend the majority of our time at the Bellagio casino in Vegas. Fashion mall and shows, but Bellagio really has the best of everything! The staff is gracious, the restaurants are all fabulous and you really do feel like you are on Lake Como with the many dining options. Can't wait to return!"
1484,5.0,Look forward to returning,"Everything and everyone provided great service. The stay was very pleasant and we would differently stay at the Bellagio again. The restaurants are excellent no need to go out for a great meal, there is an outstanding selection ."
1485,5.0,Perfect Place to stay,"Great hotel. Perfect location. Busy Casino. Free tram to Vadara, Aria and MGM. Can walk from MGM to Excalibur to free tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Clean and very nice rooms. Overall great place to stay."
1486,5.0,Still beautiful!,"In town for a guys weekend. Football viewing. Used the Bellagio Sportsbook...a little outdated compared with other options, but still serviceable. Great rates and great times....we would definitely consider going there again."
1487,4.0,Nice but basic,"A bit more hi priced than hi class. Overall the staff was professional and friendly. Room service food was less than average in quality and presentation, although their variation of a chicken club was over $20. Drinks are less than half price with double the value at other establishments. The architecture and design along with location make the Bellagio a must see while in Vegas."
1488,2.0,Service,"I have been staying at Bellagio for 20 years. Service has significantly declined over the last 3-4 years and hit bottom on our most recent stay. There were two other couples that use to meet us at Bellagio, but they are now staying at Wynn and Venetian because of service decline. Even my daughter and her husband are no longer staying at Bellagio, they are now staying at Cosmo. The casual dining restaurant menus are no longer in touch with customers. Menu changes and food offerings may be better suited for international visitors, not Americans.. Whoever is in charge of this area is not in touch with frequent US customers. Service across the board is not good. Even your employees are complaining to customers about hotel management decisions. When we asked employees at the former"
1489,4.0,Short vacation,Location of the hotel is perfect to walk on the strip at night . Price a bit high for the room they gave me . But it was a good short vacation . Room are very clean . Not like the other hotels that smell like smoke .
1490,5.0,Great experience,"We asked for an upgrade to a fountain view and it was well worth it. So much fun to see the fountains, especially at night. Great experience overall. We didn't eat there during this trip but we did have fun over all."
1491,5.0,Bellagio Hotel Las Vegas,"I always go to this hotel. You don't need to go anywhere else. The staff are all courteous. It's clean and decorated beautifully. My complaints would be: I like to get $10 bills. They limit how many they will give out. Also, I would like them to have a more middle of the road type cafe and not all high-end fancy restaurants. I like the cafe they used to have there. It had a great selection with a reasonable range of prices."
1492,5.0,Fountain View Room at The Bellagio,"Beautiful view of the famous Bellagio fountain is something to behold. Clean room, newly remodeled with central Vegas Strip location makes everything come together. Beautiful property inside and out. Fine dining and luxury shopping on premise and of course a gorgeous casino. What more could you ask for?"
1493,5.0,Would come again!,"Had a great time at the Bellagio casino I hit two jackpots in the high limit room back to back. I don’t know if any other casino that can do that for someone, especially a new member of mlife! Can’t wait to come again!"
1494,1.0,Awful,"Spa tower is a joke. Broken shower. I shouldn’t have been placed in the spa tower to begin with. Moved to a better room, lost sonicare toothbrushes and couldn’t reach lost and found. Awful experience… whatever you do, do t stay in the spa tower; so ugly and gross."
1495,5.0,BellagioRocks,"I have never had a bad experience here. With my comps and a $50 upgrade, I got an awesome fountain view room. Very comfortable as well. Will keep giving them my business. Thank you Bellagio staff. ****"
1496,3.0,Just to Getaway !,This was our first time staying at the Bellagio . We had a beautiful suite. However we were not happy with the restaurants and there were barely any beverage servers on the floor that we could have ordered a drink while playing .
1497,5.0,Quick Trip,"The hotel was very clean, staff was pleasant and accommodating. We did not dine there as lines long and reservations needed. The main level was very busy most of the day. We had a fountain view room which was nice but you can hear the fountains go off each night until midnight. Plus the load cars on the strip. If using the self parking garage it is to the left when pulling in. Take the ticket and when you check in they will through that out and give you an extra room key to keep in the car. Checking out using the tv in the room went smooth and your access to the garage will last the remainder of the day."
1498,5.0,Top notch service and comfort,This was the best vacation of my life! It was my first time here and I will surely return!!! Never in my life treated so well at a high end hotel just a great experience I don’t plan on changing my mind on returning to the Bellagio An experience everyone should experience most definitely!!!
1499,5.0,My stay at the Bellagio,What a fabulous trip I had along with a Fabulous time as always when I stay at the Bellagio. Excellent service and the staff is Amazing. The restaurants are very good and you have a choice of shopping stores. And most important of all is the Perks that are given. Thanks for a Wonderful stay
1500,5.0,Weekend getaway,Loved it there staff was friendly and helpful hotel was really clean only issue was getting the elevator to work with my room key other than that I loved my stay there I also loved the buffet great service and food
1501,5.0,Wonderful getaway,"Loved the Bellagio. Super friendly staff, great location on strip and the beds were so comfortable (wanted to take it home). Had a fountain view, best seats in the house. You won't be disappointed if you stay here."
1502,5.0,Great venue,The Belagio was exactly as I had hoped. The room was large and the bed was larger. It was clean and comfortable. The staffing was friendly and courteous and went out of the way to help. Housekeeping had the room spotless. Great stay.
1503,4.0,Almost Perfect,"Everything was great, except... Room smelled like stale cigarette smoke The light next to the bed didn't work Vending machine on floor remained unstocked the 4 days I was there. Your staff wnt above and beyond, very courteous"
1504,5.0,Opulence at its finest,Our stay at the Bellagio didn't disappoint. It was exactly what we hoped. We enjoyed our stay and even won a little money at the casino. The conservatory was one of our favorites parts of staying here.
1505,5.0,Bellagio get away,Very enjoyable stay with many restaurants to choose from in the hotel. Beautiful flowery displays and botanical garden. Very large pools and spacious lounging areas around pools. Would definitely stay at the Bellagio again.
1506,5.0,"Yes, another great stay at the Bellagio",What can I say - consistency is key. And the Bellagio delivers. The food is always good - but I hit Noodles and Lago multiple times this trip. The room key on your phone may be a little ahead of it's time - but definitely the way it's all going.
1507,5.0,Bellagio is still the place to be!,"It was so nice to see how the Bellagio remains such a perfect destination. Everything was beautiful, the flowers the displays it all felt normal and that was so refreshing! Thank you for giving us a few days of feeling like ourselves after 18 months of craziness! We will be back."
1508,5.0,Sweet treat for Halloween,"This is my favorite place to stay and my first time to travel solo. I was greeted immediately upon my arrival and had assistance storing my luggage and checking in. When my room was ready, I recieved a text instructing me to go to the kiosk to get my room key. This was a first for me and the young man monitoring/securing the elevator entrances was so kind to assist me with getting my keys printed and directing me to my room. His name was Vytheth and we had such a pleasant conversation as he assisted me. I enjoyed the bar and then dinner at Spagos, but my favorite was breakfast a couple of mornings at Sadelle's located by the amazing atrium."
1509,4.0,Bellagio stay,Our stay was good except for some problems with our hotel room. We had to move twice before we got a room that was acceptable. The front desk was very helpful in resolving our issues and provided us with a trim credit for our inconvenience
1510,5.0,Fun,We had a lot of fun and will continue to visit frequently. The service was really good and the rooms were very clean . Also the slot machines were a bit generous but could be a bit looser . The check in is perfect and fast .
1511,5.0,Excellent all around!,The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel. The location is excellent. We spent a day at the pool which was wonderful. I had an issue with the internet and the hotel clerk helped me resolve the problem immediately. The service was amazing.
1512,5.0,Amazing Property,"Everything was perfect. The blown glass atrium is a wonderful first impression. We did the mobile check-in/check-out and it worked seamlessly. The app for the room key worked well. The Mayfair Supper Club is a must do when you are at the Bellagio. It was a little pricey, but isn’t everything nowadays. All the food was great and plentiful. The staff was very kind and definitely there to serve their guest. The fountains show with the soundtrack just added to an already perfect visit."
1513,5.0,Luxury,Mobile check in was fast and easy . Room was ready early and check out went the same . We went to Mayfair’s for a great experience and great food . Saddles was also a great option for a meal. The pool area was fantastic and relaxing. The room was clean and comfortable with one of the best locations on the strip
1514,5.0,Honeymoon in Vagas,"Our Room was updated and upgraded to a higher floor, best time ever !!!!! Loved the Fountains the hotel lobby was beautiful we enjoyed our stay so much the enchanted forest theme was adorable we took wedding photos in the Garden"
1515,5.0,Friends going gambling,Love the Bellagio. We go every year and stay there. You really never need to leave the hotel if you don’t want to. They have excellent food and entertainment. The accommodations are excellent. Can’t wait for our next trip.
1516,5.0,Bellagio still a great hotel,"Have been staying at the Bellagio at least once a year for the last 15 yrs. on my birthday (66 yrs. old now) Check in was a breeze using the phone app and key printing kiosk. The room in the main bldg. was newly updated and fresh. All staff encountered were friendly and courteous. The place still has a great vibe and excellent restaurants although somewhat pricey. Wife and I used the spa which is relaxing experience for the day. Again for us Bellagio still delivers what we like, a little gambling, great restaurants, a place to relax and centrally located for walking to other places to shop and explore."
1517,5.0,First time but not last,"Very Nice hotel and amenities. Had everything and more Still during covid but everything was open and available. Could do without the parking charge, but once you pay you can park at ANY MGM property with the same ticket."
1518,5.0,first get away since covid,"The hotel is still amazing; still coping w/safety issues some of which are joy limiting (masks for all) yet once the new ideas are understood, one can get back to enjoying the time spent. All of our requests were honored and our facilities were still most accommodating. Staff still excellent!."
1519,5.0,Best hotel,Best hotel best people that work there. Slots machine are nice and very clean . Stayed for 2 nights we had fun. Restaurant are nice. Nice view of then hotel. Very clean. And i won slots machine . For sure me and my friend will be back this december
1520,4.0,JP,"Very nice place to stay in and great location. Beautiful view from the room on fountains, each show was different and worth to watch. Very good service and friendly atmosphere. Good option to be able to check in on line,"
1521,5.0,Class all around,"Icame out to Vegas for some fun and the bellagio did not dissapoint. Rooms were of highest standard, staff was refreshingly kind and pleasant. The restaurants were busy but service and attention to all the details were right spot on.. I will be back soon and this is one classy operation !!"
1522,3.0,Not a great experience.,"The hotel is very nice, but the room was not that great. Room and bath was nicely appointed but... I selected a fountain view room which had a very dirty window. The door to the room had a abnormally finicky door lock. Malfunctioning hair dryer took over an hour to replace."
1523,1.0,Disappointed,I booked 2 months in advance for the fountain view but ended up with the roof top view. I was very disappointed. I called front desk but they say they cannot do anything due to no rooms being available.
1524,5.0,Treated like Royalty,"We aren't special, but sure felt like it. Received the red-carpet treatment from the minute we arrived. This didn't stop - 5-star service the entire stay. Well done, Bellagio staff. See you again soon!"
1525,5.0,Best anniversary trip ever,All the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had the best time. We were in the fountain view stay well room. The view was absolutely amazing! We loved the staff at Sadelles. Their food was delicious. We are already planning our next trip for December!
1526,5.0,Great stay and the staff was fantastic!,"We had an unbelievable stay. The food was great, the staff went out of their way. The Bellagio was beautiful. The place was spotlessly clean! We had a great time hopping between the different MGM properties and exploring different restaurants."
1527,5.0,Another great visit,"Great service and super friendly staff, from front desk to housekeeping. Stayed in a “Stay Well” room on the 24th floor. One of the most comfortable hotel beds ever! Incredible Fountain views. Can’t wait to return."
1528,5.0,"BELLAGIO, I LOVE YOU","Excellent service , room nice and clean , fantastic and delicious food … Breakfast buffet very delicious… People are nice , can’t wait to go back Highly Recommended Highly Recommended Recommended !!!!"
1529,4.0,Nice one night stay,The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. They could use a cleaning of their windows. We had a fountain view room and the water-stained windows were kind of distracting. I know the hotel can’t really control their clientele but we saw no fewer than 4 dogs in the casino and one literally crapped on the floor. This is not what I expected from Bellagio.
1530,5.0,Fun Few Days in Vegas,"Just went to Vegas with a buddy for gambling and relaxation, had a great time. The gaming was great, staff was excellent, and we had great food and entertainment. Highly recommend Ultimate Texas Hold’em, eat at Yellowtail and Spanos."
1531,5.0,Perfect,Everything was perfect !! The service the views!! The restaurants delicious food !! This is our 3erd time will continue to go!! Thanks for everything will recommend to all of our friends.. an experience every one should have
1532,5.0,Great time,"great time...front desk was great super clean rooms, fall theme was wonderful ...and the water show, come on, just what it was suppose to be, we have seen it in movies, better in person....won some money makes it better...what Vegas is suppose to be"
1533,3.0,Okay - Not Great!,"Our room was okay. It did not have an in room coffee maker, there was only one trash can, no corkscrew for wine. Staff at the hotel was very friendly. Casino was very tight and it was hard to win any money,"
1534,5.0,Bellagio vacation,My wife and I stayed at Bellagio for 8 days. We were joined by my son and his girlfriend for 4 of those days. It was her first visit to Vegas. She was blown away by Bellagioand all else Vegas. The staff is amazing and the rooms were terrific.
1535,5.0,Customer Service,My husband and I are celebrating our 4yr Anniversary and had Ms. Anayency at the front desk helping us check in at the Bellagio. She had a great personality and did an amazing job assisting us and getting a great room!
1536,5.0,Relaxing place to visit,"Many places within a short walking distance, and you can watch the fountains from your room at night. The hotel is very well maintained, with a beautiful lobby and holiday display in the atrium. Could do without the indoor smoking or AC path that didn't take you through it to the north side of the building. The bed and pillows were comfortable, best sleepaway from home I've had."
1537,3.0,Poor housekeeping service,"We had a bad experience with housekeeping. We did not receive any housekeeping during our entire stay! It seems that they would hang our Privacy door hanger themselves to avoid cleaning the room. We hid it on the last day but still no housekeeping. Overall room quality was okay, though some of the equitlike the alarm clock was very old with the old iPhone charger. We stayed here after staying at Wynn and Venetian and there is NO comparison to them…it is no where close to those upgraded modern suites."
1538,3.0,Clean rooms but pricey,"The rooms were clean, very pricey. Expect to pay some money while here. We never ate at the hotel, went across the street to Oceans 1 for breakfast everyday. People there will either stop right in front of you or bump into you. We went to celebrate our nieces 21st birthday we had a large group and only spent a very small amount of time together. There was some Figi water on the dresser that was available for purchase but the price was $22 a bottle. We went to the store and purchased our own snacks and drinks. We were able to keep the drinks cold by putting ice in the sink. I highly doubt we'll stay here again."
1539,5.0,Another Amazing Experience,"As always the Bellagio did not disappoint! The phone checkin was convenient, the room was well kept, the staff are accommodating, the Conservatory was amazing, the Restaurants all delicious and the best pools in Las Vegas. A few restaurants were closed during our stay."
1540,1.0,No towels no clean rooms,Had to reuse towels over and over because no one brought us new towels or clean beds? Very bad services I won’t stay there again and I will let all my friends and family known about this as it feel it’s gross
1541,5.0,"very nice staff, customer service over exceeded my expectation,very relaxing place.","very highly oriented staff, excellent in customer service, room look so nice ,the music for the dancing fountain is so relaxing, the food at the buffet is so much to choose so delicious ,and the server is so nice too definitely come back again and highly recommend to family and friends."
1542,4.0,Couple of nights in the Spa Tower at Bellagio,"Much nicer compared to the older hotels on the strip....but probably heading in the same direction as the older hotels. Not as nice as the Wynn/Encore, which, I think is a newer hotel....or, they keep their hotel rooms in better condition."
1543,5.0,"Clean, safe & friendly","I love staying at the Bellagio. I always get great service and the staff are all very friendly. Staying during the Covid pandemic, cleanliness and safety was my first concern, and the Bellagio stepped up and showed up!!! I will definitely come back."
1544,5.0,Beautiful & Convenient,This is a Beautiful and convenient location. Just a few hiccups along the trip. Left in a state of amazement and awe. The fountain view room made up for any inconveniences experienced. 24 hour dining was available and it was delicious.
1545,5.0,Great stay at Bellagio!,"Very nice stay! Our room was on the 18th floor with beautiful view of fountains, Staff were wonderful from check in to bartender to housekeeping. Nice location to walk on the strip. Casino fun. Went to the O Cirque Du Solei and show was amazing!!!! Highly recommend!"
1546,4.0,If you wanna ball out—,"This is the place to be. Definitely a lot more pricey than your average hotel but the quality is there. The food is amazing and service is up there too. We dined at the caviar bar, Michael Mina, and Picasso. All were nothing short of satisfaction. The tables weren’t in my favor this trip which wasn’t the most fun many easy I’ll get it done next time. Be sure to get your money up before booking your trip. This place eats 1000s haha. Still definelty w"
1547,5.0,"The Bellagio, Opulence and Splendor.","I had the privilege to stay in one of the Stay-Well Premier Rooms facing the fountain, and the entire stay was filled with beauty, fun, excitement, and above all, world class customer service. The views are worthy of spending an entire night in your room, watching the sunrise and sunset with the Bellagio fountain shows, the casino is filled with friendly staff willing to assist and help new players learn new games, and the restaurant I attended for dinner (Prime Steakhouse) will go to nearly any length to ensure your evening is magic in every way. I am so glad that I got to have this experience in my life and would recommend it to anyone hesitant to go. This is an experience you should not miss in your life."
1548,5.0,Perfect choice,There is no reason I would be in another place to stay in Vegas. Bellagio will give satisfaction to all your senses including your imagination. You will find yourself winning in many other ways besides $$$. It’s an amazing wonderland!
1549,5.0,Bellagio - Las Vegas at Its' Best,"I have been going to Las Vegas for many years, and this was definitely the best experience at a casino so far. From exiting my car at the valet, check-in, entering my room, the shower is awesome, cleanliness of the entire property, outstanding staff service from beginning to the end. The whole Bellagio experience was simply AWESOME!"
1550,5.0,Premier Rooms not so premier,I was given a room with what appear to be feces on the bedding. It was also good on the table Particles. They offered to send housekeeping Instead of assigning another room. Just poor experience. Hotel it’s self is nice but I wasn’t please. Even window to view fountain was dirty. Some random lady knock at our door to check the mini bar contents while we were in the room. Poor experience.
1551,5.0,Five star experience,"Would absolutely stay here again. The pool was clean and gorgeous, the food options were plentiful and delicious, especially Sadelle's and Lago. The staff was amazing, from the poolside service to the gentleman at the elevator to the tower. Won't be my last time."
1552,4.0,Birthday celebration,"I celebrated my birthday at bellagio and everything was most definitely a memorable experience. The only thing that would need improvement would be the The minibar. The minibar is the only thing that needs to be changed. I called the front desk to tell them the very first night about the minibar and how I wanted to take out something to put Gatorade inside and then they told me it was censored and that it was stated in the fridge at the top, but come on now. When you’re in Vegas, nobody reads it and the front desk agent didn’t even apologize, she just said that she can’t do anything about the charges and it would remain on the bill. I didn’t complain because other than that one staff member and the minibar, it was a beautiful stay. The IRD, housekeeping, and the person who"
1553,5.0,The best,Hotel is one of the best in MLife. Dinner at Prime steakhouse was fantastic except for our waiter who did not explain the drink price to us and gave us the expensive on. Then he gave me a more expensive glass of wine than what I ordered and charged us for it. Over $70 for a glass of Rose' and a cabernet? It was corrected for us. Overall the staff is great and can't wait for our next visit.
1554,5.0,"Excellent Service, Exquisite Staff","For a comfortable stay and a brilliant venue for a business meeting, it would be very hard to beat the Bellagio. And, while life is a gamble enough without playing in the casino, and humongous crowds are not my thing, a little excitement doesn't hurt whilst on one's way to Zion National Park!"
1555,4.0,I expected more in my room,"It is the 3rd time I have stayed at the Bellagio and although the Hotel is beautiful and is very well located and maintained, the rooms do not offer what a 5-star hotel should. The size of the room and its bed are perfect, but the 5-star hotels must make their guests feel pampered, a coffee maker, daily complementary water, bathrobes, slippers and bath products with sponge, dental kit, cottons ... all the details."
1556,5.0,Top quality!!,"We had an amazing time celebrating my father's 70th birthday. Staff was friendly, hotel was beautiful and layout was easy to navigate. Restaurants were delicious and we loved the water show. Location on the strip is great."
1557,5.0,Wonderful Time was had by all!,We celebrated my Brothers 60th birthday and the experience was absolutely amazing! Top notch from start to finish! From the front door to the room you are greeted by some of the most courteous staff one could hope for. We felt valued every step of the way.
1558,5.0,Top Rated Las Vegas Experience,"From beginning to end of our stay the Bellagio offered us excellent customer service, exceptional rooms and an atmosphere that would have us highly recommend them as the place to stay when visiting Las Vegas!"
1559,5.0,5stars!,"From check in to check out this was an exceptional stay. I only had one night after a gruelling tradeshow week before flying home and the staff here made it one to remember. Amazing room upgrade, great tips from Darren the bellman for my next stay and amazing service at the cypress pool from Maritza! I want to hop right back on another plane and do it again! Thank you to the Bellagio for a big impact in a small amount of time!"
1560,4.0,Return to Bellagio after Many Years,"Returned to Bellagio after serving many years overseas. While had one person who was nice during my stay, Marlene Vilardo, I’d say that overall friendliness and customer service was above average, not up to the past exceptional standards. Bellagio Buffet used to be on par with Wynn now seems a bit disappointing in term of food quality. Comparing to the Wynn, the cost is the same, but the difference was very apparent. Not up to the times. Air quality was poor, were they saving money on air conditioning? The pool area, while nice, had people smoking cigars which ruined the experience. We celebrated our anniversary at Lago. Ambiance and service were great; however, food was so small in portion size compared to the price. Cuisine quality was okay, not great. Casino"
1561,5.0,Halloween getaway,I just moved from Sacramento to Los Angeles and got a chance to getaway for a great weekend experience with a buddy. We both got a chance to finally get away and relax. The staff and guests were all masked up and we felt safe to return home to our loved ones knowing all safety measures were in place. Thank you
1562,5.0,Beautiful!,"The Bellagio is beautiful, perfectly located, and clean. It's a lovely resort. We stayed in an updated king suite with a view of the fountain. The bed was super comfortable and we had a huge shower made for two. We also had a great view of the strip and the beautiful water show daily. We would definitely stay again. The only thing is you don't have access to a refrigerator for personal use. Other than that, you'll have a wonderful time like we did because it is in the center of everything including the mall and several other hotels."
1563,5.0,Great getaway,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Bellagio. The show (Cirque de Soleil), the buffet and the smaller cafes were all A+. It is my favorite hotel/casino in Las Vegas. The casino floor showcases a large variety of slots, gaming tables etc., and the staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are also well appointed and very clean with comfy beds and pillows. All in all, a 10 in my book."
1564,1.0,"Sad, smelly and beautiful","The property is amazing. Unfortunately is reeked of cigarettes and weed. Immediately outside the doors, you will be presented a wide variety of additional aromas to greet your senses. Scents like urine, feces, pot, and vomit. All of which I would expect from a top resort. Oh and lest I forget the greeting you receive from Las Vegas’ finest homeless drug addicts tugging at your heartstrings as you step over them to the show you just paid $700 to see. Just enough to make you wonder why you there spending your money while people are suffering. Just a great experience."
1565,3.0,BLAST FROM THE PAST!!!,"It looks like a retirement home for Rich Old People. The hotel is nice but the vibe and the ambiance along with food options and layout just scream senior citizen. I normally stay at Aria and/or Cosmo when I am in Vegas and figured lets give Bellagio a try, hotel doesnt look like its been rennovated since 1995."
1566,5.0,Lower48Traveling,We had a fantastic time and Beautiful room with amazing views of the strip and fountains. The staff is so friendly and very helpful. The public areas are amazing with all the lush flowers!! We also loved the Buffet!! Definitely recommend the hotel
1567,3.0,Not worth the effort and payment,"when you first get all you can see and hear is ppl smoking! if you hate it? Vegas is not the place for you nor the Bellagio! smoking is everywhere and the smell hunts you to the elevators and rooms hallways. check-in lines are SO long and no line for handicapped!!! staff at check-in was not friendly and though we got our room 1 hour earlier... no wonder - it wasn't clean. dust was everywhere stickiness at the drawers handles, bathroom floor not wiped/ cleaned well. Even La-Quinta hotels that I had to take for business trips were cleaner. I was and am very very disappointed. I took my parents to enjoy, relax and see Vegas in a fancy hotel.... I got a bad experience. the room was large yet nothing better that other cheaper smaller hotels. The room definitely did not matched the"
1568,2.0,Nice place to vist but not to book,Had to switch rooms twice for a total of 3 rooms. All 3 rooms we had were fountain view rooms. They are over priced big time for how basic the rooms are. The first room had no water pressure in the shower. The sink water had a very pungent smell and tasted very bad when brushing teeth. The air conditioner did not work in room 1. We were switched to another room that we would not even walk into because of the EXTREME smell of cigarettes/cigars in the room. Immediately called the front desk and were moved yet again. 3rd room of the stay and we encountered the same problems as room number 1. Water pressure was terrible and the A/C was poor at best. This was honestly the worst hotel experience I have ever had in Las Vegas.
1569,4.0,Nice Hotel and Location,"Only thing we didn't like was the surprise $104 ""resort fee"" after booking. Unexpected fees are shady. Just tell me up front what the cost is going to be. Other than that, the hotel was great and we enjoyed our stay."
1570,4.0,Enjoyed our stay,"Bellagio is generally our hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas. The staff is helpful. We really like the Bellagio pool, which is definitely geared towards adults. We like playing in the Bellagio casino. It has all of the games that we like."
1571,5.0,The most memorable anniversary ever!,"We stayed in the king suite, and it was lovely. The mirror TV in the bathroom was a nice touch. My vanity was large enough to occupy all my cosmetics larger than the Venetian king suite that we stayed at during our last 3 nights in Vegas. The space was very functional that included two tables and a sectional that made it very comfortable."
1572,5.0,Bellissimo Bellagio,"We stayed in many different casinos in Vegas, but somehow the last few years we end up staying at the Bellagio Resort and Casino. This is really our favorite, and it’s not only because we get a room facing the fountains, but also because of the exceptional service we receive from everyone. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean, not to mention the comfy beds. The casino is very spacious and provides easy access to the strip and other casinos, shops and restaurants. There is also a tram to Crystal/Aria or Park MGM (the old Monte Carlo). The pool area is big with a poolside cafe which offers breakfast/lunch. The atrium next to the lobby is always decorated for the season. Very beautiful. Fine dining at Mayfair restaurant provides dinner shows. Highly recommended. Can’t wait to go"
1573,2.0,It was eh,"I wasn't impressed or necessarily disappointed in this property. It did have more negatives than positives though. Like there was fecal matter on our bathroom floor by the toilet. There were toilet paper squares with blood spots on them on the floor. They said they would have housekeeping come by. never saw them for all 4 days. on our first night, we noticed the AC didn't work too well. it would blow I guess room temp air? but not cold air. When we called about that and asked if we could just switch rooms they told us there would be a $25 upgrade fee. feeling that we overpaid already we respectfully declined. After sweating for a second night we called and asked to switch rooms again because this was ridiculous at this point. Still told we had to pay the upgrade fee, even"
1574,5.0,Luxury that's comfortable,"This is by far my favorite hotel. I have stay in many and this is the most comfortable. There are rooms over the fountain which is fun to watch. There are 2 floors of spa-like rooms if you want that atmosphere, with aome over the fountains as well. There is a separate spa tower that avoids the casino, with the spa, gym, coffee store & separate pool entrance if you want a more quiet experience. There are a few pools to choose from that are not a scene. Love to start and finish my trip at the lobby bar with piano music and great snacks! Love it here!"
1575,4.0,Beautiful but the get you on all the extra's,"Beautiful Hotel but they charge a ridiculous net $45 resort fee daily which adds up quickly. In room can of soda is $10, Water $14. I know its vegas and a top hotel but the extras add up quick. Being a hotel with a casino, the fees are over the top."
1576,4.0,Beautiful venue with to much smoke and very loud.,"Beautiful venue. Be warned however that the casino is a ""full smoking"" location. This is the kind of smoking that for non smokers leaves your eyes watering and your clothes smelling after only 5 minutes."
1577,2.0,Disappointed,"First visit was so-so. This most recent visit was awful. I booked a room and took the steps to check in online. Our flight arrived late so we got to the hotel past midnight, expecting our room to be ready. The staff said that there were no rooms available with 2 queens. Took him over 20 minutes to find an accessible room with 2 queens. I asked about Gold benefits, and he said he only knew I get valet parking for free and the rest I have to go to the MGM Rewards desk to find out. I was tired so left it at that. Turned out that our room had a broken shower and a broken curtain. We mentioned it to the front desk the next day.they said they’d address it. Only the shower knob was fixed. Curtain never fixed. So we basically paid 400/night for no window or sunlight. Really upset."
1578,4.0,Still one of the Best,The Bellagio is still a beautiful gem. Some rooms have been refurbished but not all. We still love the place but some areas need updating. The staff is super helpful and go out of their way to make things great.
1579,1.0,AWFUL EXPERIENCE,"Noisy room. Air conditioner so loud that it kept me up. When I informed the front desk upon checkout, they took no responsibility. Refused to compensate in any way and blamed me for not calling maintenance in the middle of the night. I will NEVER stay at the Bellagio again!"
1580,3.0,Bad experience,"I book a fountainview room, and of course I pay more for the view, and went I get there, they put me in another type of room because they don't have any availale at the moment, so we have to stay one night in another room with the view to the HWY, also the room smells so bad."
1581,5.0,Paradise,"The room was so nice and clean, the staff were all friendly and helpful. The pool was my favorite spot to enjoy the sunshine in Vegas! The location is right in the middle of the strip so it’s east to go anywhere. Highly recommend!"
1582,5.0,Fabulous stay!,"Stayed at the Bellagio 4/20-4/25 and loved every moment! The pools were fabulous, very relaxing and great service. The room we had was wonderful. We stayed in the spa tower 24th floor and had a suite at the end of the hall so it was a corner room and the views were amazing. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was beautiful. We chose one of the older rooms because I love to soak in a hot bath after walking 20k steps each day. Ate at Mayfair one night too and that was also great. From the moment we checked in until we checked out we were always happy with the service we received. We typically stay at Caesar’s but are so glad we have Bellagio a chance since we actually prefer gambling there. We will definitely be back!"
1583,5.0,Las Vegas’ excellent place to stay: Bellagio,Excellent hotel. food at Yellow Tail restaurant was fantastic.Location is the best. It has beautiful musical fountain. I will love to stay at Bellagio only if get a chance to visit Las Vegas again. Truly amazing experience!
1584,5.0,Best in Vegas,"The best part of the Bellagio is it’s centrally located spot on the strip along with staff friendliness. I recommend paying the extra fee for the Cypress Pool as the staff there is exceptional. We always stay at this MGM property and if traveling to Vegas, it’s the spot to be."
1585,5.0,Bellagio is the Best in Vegas!,"I don’t post reviews often, but I have to say, the Bellagio has always provided the best experiences. The property is gorgeous, the staff and crew are so kind, welcoming and professional. The restaurants and their teams provide the best meals in Vegas, and the Entertainment is phenomenal. Special shout out to the cast, crew and musicians at Mayfair Supper Club! The Bellagio is our go to spot. My wife and I wont stay anywhere else when in Vegas!"
1586,5.0,Upgrade was very special... :-),"I upgraded to a penthouse 2 bedroom suite and it was beautiful! My niece was able to join me this trip and we had a memorable time. The food was better than last year, and the weather was perfect! Thank you!"
1587,5.0,Great Place,"Fantastic room, very clean, some great restaurants but skip the Sadelle’s. Fantastic ambiance. Great gym. Good friendly service. Hard to get drinks when gambling and gaming drinks are of low quality but paid drinks are good."
1588,4.0,Best Staff In Vegas,Most friendly staff in Las Vegas. Clean facility and room. Food was appropriately priced in most cases. Only issues was with the MGM app. Seems like it has a ways to go to provide it's intended usefulness.
1589,5.0,Excellent Experience,perfect location very clean staff very friendly was very quiet during night hours casino was very clean and very spaced out the water show was excellent and the food was really good at the buffet would definitely stay there again

I recommend the buffet please arrived at 10am or 11am I can es eat double! Breakfast and the lunch at the same time!"
1591,4.0,Prime Location,"Located at the center of the strip, close to everything. Excellent service but, you have to request that your room is cleaned or they won't do it. TV stopped working after the 2nd day but no big deal as it will be fixed as soon as you report it. Room seemed due for a remodel; it's quite nice for the time the hotel opened."
1592,5.0,Accommodating and Clean!,Excellent place! Very helpful and accommodating when my flight was cancelled and had to stay another night. Very very clean! The pools were also very nice! Such a great location as well. We could easily walk anywhere !

1595,5.0,Still the Tops in Vegas,"There are newer properties but the Bellagio is still tough to beat in the middle of the Strip. Outstanding views, rooms, and please take the time to enjoy a dinner at Prime Steakhouse overlooking the fountain. You will not regret it!"
1596,5.0,Excellent,The prices was excessive for minimal product. Microwaves should be provided without extra cost. Extra fees and or deposites for check in should not be charges. Charging for wifi should not admit. Overall no other complaints.
1597,5.0,Annual Friend Getaway,Another awesome trip to Vegas with friends! 3rd time staying at Bellagio with this group and a total of close to 10 times over the last 15 years. Bellagio is first class in all aspects and is in the best spot on the strip!
1598,5.0,A Happy customer,"It was more then I expected and food,the customer service is un real I could not be any happier. The location of the hotel is a prime spot for alot of things to.

Mr. Frankie Escalante was extremely helpful and took the time for upgrading our stay which we have not experience during the last few time staying at the Bellagio our home away from home in Las Vegas. My wife was also provided with a rose. This experience could not have been any better! Thanks to Mr. Escalante!
1601,5.0,Amazing,"Stayed4 nights for a convention, on the third night the plumbing behind the wall leaked to the unit below so management moved me but also upgraded me into a much nicer room. I have to tell you it made me feel like I was very important at the time. I would highly recommend this casino to all my friends. A special thanks to Gregg Williams for looking out for me he's the best. Danny D."

1605,5.0,Carole Ann is the Best Dealer,"Talk about a fun time. 4 hours at a blackjack table and losing has never been as fun.. but thanks to Carole Ann made it awesome!!! She’s funny, her dry sense of humor. One of the best dealers I’ve ever had!"
1606,5.0,Vacation,"Everything was amazing. The staff goes above and beyond. The conservatory was so beautiful. I was really impressed by the buffet. They had everything. Prime rib, bone marrow, and seafood. The rewards program is awesome."

1608,4.0,It is still a nice place,It isn't Steve Wynn's Bellagio so don't expect 5 star everything but it is nice and fun to stay and play. I love the fountain view and it has a good selection of restaurants. It gets crowded but then all of the Strip is now.
1609,5.0,Best stay I’ve ever had in Vegas,It was perfect! Will definitely stay again. My husband and I had a king room and my parents had a Bellagio Suite! Both were nice. Room service was nice and food was good. The views of the fountains were amazing!
1610,5.0,great stay,Amazing stay !! What I liked best is you could take the elevator down to the casino level and you are very close to all the restaurants. The pool was great and the kids had a blast. We would love to stay at the Bellagio next time
1611,5.0,Heaven on earth,"Absolutely the best. Superb service, delicious restaurants, heavenly atmosphere. The hotel and casino are pure class and the conservatory is unreal. If you go, make it a point to be there. Wouldn't stay anywhere else."

1614,5.0,My favorite place to stay,"Great service, clean rooms, fountain show, with shopping & my favorite gambling machines and tables. The Bellagio is right around everything I want to do and everything I want to eat while I’m in Las Vegas"
1615,1.0,AVOID This place at all cost,"I am a MLife Gold member that booked through AMEX FHR. Upon arrival, I checked in at the lobby and was given a warm welcome by team member Roselyn (female asian team member). She assured me that during my stay, I will be able to have resort waived on top of other FHR perks. And if I see the folio reflecting resort fees I should talk to her because she will be working the day I check out as well. I was also offered a small upgrade to the NEWLY Renovated Preimer King on the 27th floor room number 27011 and I was told that this is a nonsmoking room on nonsmoking floor. I was excited to check out the new room, however to my disappointment, the bathroom light was glitching and it flickers at ON position making the experience rather horrible. To top it off, there is constantly smell"
1616,5.0,Bellagio Stay,Everything in the hotel is amazing The staff were all very professional n welcoming at the same time I would definitely stay there Restaraunts need to b open later than 3 in the afternoon Loved whatever we ate
1617,5.0,Best hotel in Vegas,Most elegant hotel in Vegas; worth every penny. Best food & best experience overall. It has the nicest people and the nicest overall environment; very elegant. Big enough to not even get out of the hotel; all amenities.
1618,1.0,Awful,I spent a lot of money in your casino Was treated awful by your staff. Actually stayed an extra day which had to pay over full price because I couldn’t prove how much money I spent there. Wow. Get your slot machines fixed so your player cards work The fact that I have to prove I spent well over 10 k is ridiculous. Check your cameras. Or your casino cage where I took out 10 k in cash advance. Maybe next time a guest asks a waitress for a cup of coffee he shouldn’t have to prove he stays there Any questions Leif sunde. 509 216 8656
1619,5.0,A luxury experience,"I highly recommend. Loved the deep bathtub, and the decor. I went as a staycation with my kids and I also wanted to take pictures of my bag line in a nice room. I wish They could have waved the resort fee because I only stayed one day and didn't use any of the amenities."
1620,5.0,First time,"What a beautiful resort! Excellent food, service, friendly staff! Our room had an amazing view, with Luxurious beds. Made it the perfect place to come back to rejuvenate. We’re looking forward to coming back!"
1621,5.0,Comfortable Environment,"Rooms are VERY nice. The casino is much less chaotic than Caesar's. Location is great, easy access to everything and anything. Dining choices are extremely expensive; even Snacks was $60 for a burger, fries and a salad."
1622,5.0,Lady Gaga experience,The Bellagio Lady Gaga experience was exceptional. The checkin and checkout process was easy and seamless. I used my digital key during my stay. The Bellagio suite was amazing. The hospitality and friendliness of staff was appreciated and our seats and the show unforgettable!
1623,5.0,Beautiful and great location!,"This was my fourth trip to Vegas and first stay at Bellagio. Room was nice, casino, pool and hotel were beautiful! Went to pool early and had no trouble getting a lounge chair. Location great as well, close to many things."
1624,5.0,Great Property,The Sadelle brunch was my favorite spot to eat. Rooms were great with pool view. Room service was prompt. Front desk agents and Managers were helpful to resolve any issues during the stay. This was our second time and would come back here again.
1625,5.0,Luxury with a view,I just loved being pampered at the Bellagio Casino and Resort. Fountain view room and the view was incredible. Multiple and diverse eating choices. Love the breakfast on the pool restaurant. Beautiful way to start your day
1626,1.0,room location according to price and bell service,"paid 1900 for 2 nights. according to this price room should on a decent location. they gave me room at 6th floor (6123) all they way back of tower, not a good outside view, mattres were not comfortable. n the bell service guy was asking for Tip, when I decline he ask me for online transfer thru cash app, agian I said no then he get aggressive n throw my suits on luggage like people throw trash, very bad experience with Bellagio. it was mine third stay here, no more MGM"
1627,3.0,Comfortable,Very good location most of the staff were very nice a little smokey all in all a comfortable stay most likey stay again...........................restaurants were great but prices have gone way up so be prepared to apy more in Vegas now...................
1628,1.0,Don’t waste your money on the Cypress Suite,"When I tried to check into the Cypress Suite I was told the room was not available because a “vip” was still occupying the room. I kept checking back with the front desk and got different stories about the status of the room. At 4PM, they gave us a temporary room because we had dinner reservations at 5PM (btw…the temp room had semen stains all over the sofa, which seems about par for bellagio) and I was told, by the manager, the room was actively being cleaned and she would call me when it was ready. I ended up missing my dinner waiting for the manager to call. She finally called at 7:15PM to let me know the room was ready. Since we were already out we did not get checked in until almost midnight. This whole experience ruined a trip we’d been planning for months. We will"
1629,5.0,Another great stay!,"We've stayed at the Bellagio many times and it is our favorite. It is not a discount hotel and things are pricey, but quality and service is terrific! Be sure to go to Lagos and enjoy the personal bar service by Marco and the staff."
1630,5.0,Going Gaga in Vegas,"Met great friends from Florida at Bellagio. They invited us to the Lady Gaga show - which was simply amazing! The memories will last a lifetime and Bellagio was the PERFECT backdrop for our reunion. A special ""Thanks"" to all the staff that helped make this such a memorable experience...we'll be back!"
1631,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,"I had a wonderful experience at the hotel! All of the staff, from the receptionists to the casino workers to the gift shop cashiers were excellent and made me feel like a valued client. I will definitely stay at the hotel again!"
1632,1.0,Men already in My Room,"There were two men already in my room. They had key cards to it. Luckily we ran into them instead of finding out by having them walk in on us, two women. Bellagio didn’t even think it was a big deal, handled poorly for resolution."
1633,5.0,AMAZING,The scenery in this hotel is spectacular. It is also in the middle of the strip so you can turn either left or right and anything you want is in walking distance. Lots of great restaurants along with great customer service.
1634,2.0,Rude housekeeping,"I asked housekeeping where trash was or if I could leave an empty coffee tray and empty cups with her, she snatched it with force and tossed it on the floor, she spoke no words at all, nothing courteous. I will let no one take anything from me that way so I walked down the hall myself (which I could have done if she could have SPOKEN and guided me where the trash was). Out of all this I called the front desk and Jazmine said oh “sorry for the bad experience” but that’s a separate department. Wtf? Like it’s this a 800 customer service #?? Went over to gamble at Venetian - not giving them that."
1635,2.0,Worse Housekeeping & Front Desk,"We have stayed in Bellagio many many times but this time was VERY disappointing with the quality of the service. After the check-in, we went to the room and the safety box was locked. We called the front desk and they informed us technical Service personnel will be there in 15-20 minutes. We waited for 1.5 hrs and nobody showed up. They showed up after 2 hrs of waiting. It wasn't a big deal since we understand they can be busy with another technical service in the hotel but at least let us know if you are going to be late. Housing Keeping: We checked in in a dirty room and used towels, the next 4 days they didn't come to clean the room until 6:00 PM when it was time to get ready for dinner. Called the front desk and the only thing they responded was that they will send someone"
1636,5.0,The bellagio experience,"Security and baggage, Vycheth tith was a pleasure and let us know where to get started at the hotel he accommodated with moving our room to another part of the hotel and was a pleasure to deal with. Aris from saddles who was our server this morning for breakfast. The breakfast is a must if you ate staying here. Aris takes the time to take pictures for us and was always there when we needed him. Beautiful French restaurant, beautiful decor. Amazing food.! Joe and Toni made my moms 65th birthday amazing at the Mayfair supper club, also a must see. Dinner and a show you can't go wrong. Plus the food is to die for Last but no least Nicole at the cypress pool is amazing. THANK YOU BELLAGIO!"
1637,5.0,Te best on strip!,"The bellagio is an awesome hotel. I have been to most on the strip and everything is top notch. Expansive gaming clean, friendly service, great restaurants. No question that we will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1638,5.0,Perfect stay,"One of the most beautiful hotels in the world. The lobby, the architecture, the decorations, the fountains, the gardens, everything is amazing. It was a pleasure to stay here. Will be coming back soon."
1639,2.0,There are better options out there,"Booked directly with the hotel for a fountain view, paid over $600 per night and the initial room selected was a side view. I offered a $100 tip to help get a better view, which I did get, however the room was a wreck. Save your money, stay elsewhere. You won't even miss the fountains."
1640,5.0,Gorgeous Hotel,"My 3rd time staying at the Bellagio, they never fail, always accommodated me, even though I’m only MGM Pearl account holder, from the front desk to the house keeper, and the bell person, great customer service.. this hotel is gorgeous, is close to everything.. I will definitely stay here again.."
1641,1.0,Will never ever stay at Bellagio again,"The room was NOT cleaned properly, found a bunch of hair on the wall in shower booth, H/K never came even I waited for more than 45 mins, disgusting sewer smells came from the shower booth all the time, the wallpaper fallen off in the bathroom, mini bar has been charged even we didn't drink anything, H/K staffs were so unprofessional"
1642,5.0,Long weekend at the amazing Bellagio!,"The property, ambiance and resort staff were amazing. Beautiful room, pool and location on the strip. Definitely a step above all the other properties we've stayed at before. Been raving about our experience to many since our return home. The staff at the Bellagio is top notch and we will be returning because of them."
1643,5.0,Top Notch! Nothing Beats the Bellagio,"This is the best hotel on the Las Vehas Strip. Even after 24 years in service the place is clean, bright and the newly remodeled rooms are terrific. I highly recommend a stay here. You cannot beat the location and the friendly staff make the extra cost worth while."
1644,3.0,Ok but not all it’s made out to be,"Hotel is fine….that’s about it. The rooms are tired and very well ‘used’. There is no premium factor to this hotel. Just another aging hotel on the strip.’ The extra fees for literally everything is a bit much….i asked for a kettle in my room and the ‘rental’ fee for 2 days was $48….crazy! On a positive note, the Service was ok and check-in was very quick and easy with the MGM app."

1646,5.0,Housekeeping and Cocktail Service,The housekeeping when they cleaned my room kept the dishes from room service in the and still didn’t put another comforter on my second bed so one bed had a comforter and one bed did not I checked out early because of it.
1647,5.0,Wonderful stay!,Our room was beautiful and over the fountains of Bellagio. I liked the security of having to use your key to get on the elevator. We ate at Jasmine and the restaurant is very classy and the service was excellent. We had a great dinner. We had a great stay and would definitely come back.
1648,5.0,Superb Service,We went on a girls trip to celebrate a birthday and a graduation and had a blast. The service at Bellagio was above and beyond. When we went to other casinos during our stay it was extremely apparent that the Bellagio was superior when it came to guest service.
1649,4.0,overall,it was a nice stay. It could have used a few perks that would have made it superb but they just weren't there. Maybe on our return visit you can do a better job. Keep us in mind for that return visit. thank you
1650,5.0,Classic Bellagio,"Classic high end Bellagio with a nicely renovated room. Super sick bathroom, and we lucked out with a view. Staff was friendly and we had some luck at the tables. I recommend the Mayfair Supper club if you can afford to spurge"
1651,5.0,Lovely hotel,Stayed in fountain view room and enjoyed watching them. The conservatory was beautiful as always. Breakfast from coffee shop by pool of muesli and breakfast sandwich was great way to start day. Lunch at Lago was lovely but unfortunately no fountain show at that time. Noodles food was delicious and good value. Many of the Machines were mean but managed to find a few that paid and at least gave some hope of winning.
1652,3.0,Underwhelming,"For a luxury resort, my stay didn't meet expectations. The pillows in the room were poor and uncomfortable. There was a noisy HVAC outside of the room that came on every hour or so and was noisy enough to disturb my sleep. The shower pressure was weak and there wasn't a coffee machine in the room either. For a luxury resort I would expect a far better experience."
1653,1.0,Mediocre at best loud Hotel rooms from near by dance clubs and the hotel room looked like 1989,Soar neck the next morning Cheap mattress and pillows Total loud room couldn’t sleep from the clubs next door total medicore at best experience i the room was like form 1989 i was really surprised it was that poor
1654,1.0,Awful experience.,"If you want dogs walking in the casino all the time, great place. Also my room was not cleaned when I arrived. Towels in the floor, an electric toothbrush was in the shower, and papers from previous guest all over. Will not go back to Bellagio."
1655,5.0,"When you’re here, your family","SON TRAN and MARY HALL are the nicest, most caring people in this casino establishment. They make you feel like a celebrity in sea of gamers. The attention they give and the well wishes are more than enough to invite them to my next birthday party!"
1656,5.0,"Another great stay, with great staff","Yet another great stay at the Bellagio. The only negatives are it seems to be harder to keep MGM rewards status post Covid, like maybe their formulas for calculating tier credits changed. We have been Gold for years. Realizing after this trip that we might not get there this year (I understand this is not related directly to the hotel itself). Also, a couple of the blackjack dealers were a little rude. That can be expected at any casino though. Overall all the staff and dealers are friendly. Front desk staff are always trying to accomodate any requests. We were at the casino, the restaurants, the pool, etc... All top notch. We will definitely be back again later this year."
1657,4.0,Great place. But I expected better from the $1000/night price,Awesome service and facilities. The location is superb since places on the strip are interconnected. My friend left her purse at Harvest and it was found and turned in to the Bellagio Lost n Found by their staff. She was able to get it a day after. Big thanks to them. The price only includes access to the room and the pool. Things in the mini bar fridge are at additional cost with ridiculous prices The TV in the room doesn’t include any popular streaming services. You’ll have to pay to rent individual movies. On the interesting note is you can also rent/buy adult only movies
1658,4.0,Girls trip with a view and wonderful pool,5 star but the TV did not work and took them 4 hours to get to the room and fix it. Plus our room was not cleaned while we were there 4 days.. We called and still did not get it cleaned. So went to the main desk and they took off the resort fee... Oh and the wake up call did not work. Pool and pool cafe were the best. Jennifer was a great server at the pool. Grounds were clean and beautiful. Can not beat the view.
1659,4.0,Smoke filled Bellagio,"The Bellagio is a nice property to stay at when in Las Vegas. Rooms are nice, staff tries to put the customer first and the location is mid-strip and that is a plus. The casino has a lot of the games I like and hit frequent enough BUT the casino is extremely smoke filled. There has to be a way to vent the air better than it is currently."
1660,5.0,Great Business Trip,I came here for a business trip and was immediately blown away by the lobby. The botanical garden is a must see! The room where I stayed was clean with an incredible view of the pools. The conference rooms are huge and the overall decor is beautiful.
1661,4.0,Sister trip,Overall it was a nice stay felt like because I was using free rooms we were out way in the back with the worst view also the bathtub had dirt in it. Most of the staff were very polite and friendly but found someone of them to be rude.
1662,4.0,Awesome hotel and great view,"We selected the fountain view king room and loved the view and hotel room. The bed was super comfortable, and the room was very organized and clean. The only issue is the size of the casino and the distance you have to walk from hotel lobby to guest elevators. The casino floor is a bit confusing and very congested (during normal hours)"
1663,5.0,Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I had an exceptional experience staying at the Bellagio. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is professional and the rooms are very clean and quiet. Not to mean the wonderful restaurants at the Hotel. We look forward to returning."
1664,2.0,Not worth the money,"There was some type of vibrating noise heard in our room at various times of the day and night that made it hard to sleep. It sounded like a jackhammer. There was also 3 lanes closed off fronting the hotel 24/7 as the hotel was setting up a stage in the fountains for the draft. This caused so much traffic to get into the hotel…adding another 15-30 minutes to our drive every time we left the hotel. Not exactly the top notch experience we were hoping for. It was our first time staying at Bellagio and might possibly be our last. You need to scan your hotel card to use the elevator but the elevator starts going up so quickly…so if there’s 2-3 people scanning ahead of you, you might very well have passed your floor before you can scan your card."
1665,5.0,Lovely hotel,"Considering the size of this hotel, the service and stay were fantastic! It was a surprise birthday celebration and we received a Lovely upgrade to fountain view room at check in.. everything spotless, staff attentive and the Easter display was amazing! Will be back!!"
1666,1.0,Extremely old filthy rooms,"I had left this review with pictures before, but I logged in and saw that it was taken down. The pictures speak for themselves. This was during COVID, and they gave me a filthy room. Stains of some kind of body fluid all over place, trash still in the room. It was so bad that we did not want to stay in the hotel, so we went downstairs and just checked out. Their response is also attached. They waived the early departure fee, wow great gesture. Bellagio wasted hours of our trip by giving us a nasty room, but I guess they didn't charge for leaving. 🤦‍♂️"
1667,5.0,Family trip,"Best location and excellent of public area quality. But the room was not clean like a 5 star hotel, and all towels were too used and toilet paper and Toiletries that were not the 5 star hotel standards for sure"
1668,5.0,Loved!!!,We loved our stay! The staff that we encountered was very nice and helpful. The pools are very nice but very cold. The casino is not crowded feeling and is well air conditioned unlike some we walked through. It does take the girls a while to get your drinks to you. Out of my 5 days my husband and i only recieved 3 drinks each while playing slots. Prime was Ok. It was definitely not as good as I though it would be. DEFINITELY BE PREPARED TO WALK A LOT!!!
1669,5.0,bachelorette,i love my stay beautiful amazing friendly and breathtaking… Thank you for an amazing time with all the beautiful art around amazing nice friendly happy people .. The pool service was also great amazing she was constantly asking if i needed anything.. attendant was very attentive.. Thank you all who was apart of my special trip .. spectacular 2022
1670,5.0,Anniversary & Birthday Celebration,"We chose the Bellagio because we had heard about it over the years and their fountains. It was a dream come true and the service, from the beginning to the end of our visit, was impeccable and filled with care. We will definitely return as there is more to discover in Las Vegas!"
1671,5.0,Nice accommodation,"I'm in Vegas 2 or 3 times each year. I've stayed here most of the time. Great rooms, friendly front desk staff! Location, location, location! Close to everything. Just a few steps from all my favorite restaurants and shopping."
1672,5.0,Best hotel in Vegas,"Beautiful hotel, great restaurants and the beds are the most comfortable in Vegas!! Love the Bellagio! Upgrade to fountain view! It’s worth it. The conservatory is always a must see in Vegas and it never disappoints!"
1673,5.0,Bellagio,"Nice property, good location. Lots of activities. Great staff. The receptionist was very courteous, patient and found us nice room, although we checked in very early. Easy instructions to find our room, which was large and very comfortable, overlooking the town. We vwere on 20th floor with a panaromic view of glittering Las Vegas."
1674,3.0,Bathroom sink smelled terrible,Poor cleanliness and there was a terrible smell coming from our bathroom sink that spread through our whole room. Everything about our stay was ok besides that but considering the price for such a established hotel I was disappointed.
1675,3.0,Bellagio,There seem to be too many people in this hotel for the amount of services offered. As there is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room you have to go find coffee in the morning. The beautiful Sadelles restaurant is at least an hour line to get in. Starbucks in the hotel is 30 minutes wait. More breakfast options is definitely needed. The remodeled rooms have had the bath tub removed which was really disappointing.
1676,4.0,Pretty Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful. Service was good. Just very expensive but overall good experience. Location is great as well, waking distance to lots of things. Some less expensive dining options would be great as well. But food was good at each place we ate in the hotel."
1677,5.0,Very elegant and a good central location.,"The Bellagio was very elegant. The decor is stylish and the service excellent. After several recent trips for conferences at resorts with no daily cleaning and having to call to request clean towels, the full service and spotless rooms were very welcome. It is also a good central location on the strip."
1678,1.0,Great location awfully outdated rooms,Bellagio is a great casino and hotel but rooms are outdated and need major renovation. As compared to competitors is more expensive and have less to offer. I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking to spend their special occasion there.
1679,3.0,Good hotel but was expecting more,Kind of just expected a bit more from a 5 star hotel casino. Seemed like they had a lot of technical problems and that’s something I just wouldn’t expect from one of the top casinos on the strip. Staff was good and room/view were good.
1680,3.0,Overpriced and overrated,"Bed was horrible sunken pit in the middle, let staff know after horrible sleep. They provided me with a strudy mattress that felt like a rock. I stayed at Aria next 2 night and beds has no issues. Staff at Bellagio made it seem like it was my issue and not the bed being on its last leg."
1681,5.0,Easy Check In beautiful rooms,Stayed for two nights in Las Vegas. Beautiful rooms with a nice view. The buffet is closed for dinner though. Highly recommend a Bellagio if you can afford it like big comfortable rooms with clean pillows and bedding.
1682,5.0,"Beautiful, Clean, Helpful staff","Self check is so easy - avoid the check in lines and print your room keys at the self check counter, beautiful conservatory next to Sadelle's restaurant is worth the crowds, many little extra services make the price reasonable in my opinion"
1683,5.0,Birthday trip,My experience was great for the most part. My phone was stolen on the second day which is not the hotel fault. I wish that security would of been more helping with tracking it down as I work for a very large company and us my phone for work. Other than that my stay was amazing. Enjoyed the location. Only other issue was I got the fountain view room and the fountain was not on due to the draft that was coming up. Other than that everything was great.
1684,5.0,Great Experience,The staff was very friendly. The front desk made an extra effort to make sure my room was close to the convention center to minimize my daily walk to the event. Very much appreciated. Very clean rooms.
1685,2.0,Worst Hotel Experience,"As soon as you’re checking in it feels like you’re at a car dealership trying to sell you on an upgrade. We ended up paying for an upgraded room and quickly regretted it. AC was not cooling and instead of switching us rooms they just sent maintenance THREE times during our 4 night stay. Beautiful hotel but that’s all it is. You’re paying outrageous prices for horrible service and rooms. Not all rooms may be horrible but this “upgraded” room was not worth it especially being for my daughters birthday. Oh and not kid friendly at all. We had a red coat guy follow us around while we walked THROUGH the casino. She wasn’t even near a slot machine and we were harassed three times! My daughter was standing on the walk way of the casino while I pulled money from the ATM, was buying her a"
1686,5.0,Lived up to the hype somehow,"I always worry about whether hotels that are hyped as much as the Bellagio will really live up to it, but it did. The hotel is beautiful, has a ton of amenities and restaurants, but most importantly service was top notch. Everyone was incredibly friendly to our family. Front desk got our two rooms as close together as possible as requested, another front desk person saw my daughter and got her a stuffed animal, the concierge overhead my wife was celebrating a birthday and got her a rose, and the bell person (Tracy) gave us a whole overview of the resort and key Las Vegas things to know while dropping off our luggage. Every staff person we passed on our hallway said hi. And of course the fountain shows were magnificent."
1687,5.0,Good,"stayed for 3 days & 2 nights at bellagio. everything was good, my sisters and i slept very well. it was quiet on our floor so that was a plus for me. the building was just overall aesthetic from the fountain to the gardens. the fitness center also have everything"
1688,5.0,Won’t stay anywhere else in Vegas,I truly believe The Bellagio is a world class hotel. There are many long time employees and their dedication shows in their interactions with customers. Bellagio has a vibe that very few hotels on the strip can match.
1689,5.0,Best way to take in Vegas,"Location, location, location! Iconic hotel and being in the heart of the strip is great. From the seamless check in and check out process, to the wellness rooms we stayed in, this is the way to stay in Vegas. Highly recommend."
1690,4.0,Bellagio Hotel rating,"I really did enjoy my stay at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino Resort. I had some minor issues with my room (sink was broken, housecleaning failed to clean my room, and air conditioner was not working properly), but the overall experience was still good. This was the first time I had issues."
1691,5.0,All Round Excellent Stay at Bellagio in Fountain View Room,I stayed six nights in April in renovated Fountain View Room 25008 and thoroughly enjoyed my relaxing stay. Check in clerk met a my requests including providing a small mobile refrigerator for my medicine(I am 80). Only exterior sound I head was the fountains water thrusts during the shows and they where hardly noticeable. The Spring Conservatory display was fantastic and I enjoyed low bet slot playing and actually hit a few good hits so I came home with more money that I took for slot play. Room and hotel was clean and pleasant smelling except for the cigarette and cigar smokers which I avoided. Also played some in the non smoking casino at Park MGM reachable by free tram from Bellagio to Park MGM. I'm ready to come back. I had considered other hotels such as Palazza/Venetian
1692,2.0,"Not high end, just expensive","Positives—rooms are clean. Establishment is gorgeous. Beds are comfy and showers are nice with good water pressure. Negatives…not “high end” just high priced. Room wasn’t serviced by housekeeping. Concierge just shrugged and said “it happens” when we asked why housekeeping hadn’t been by. We needed clean towels and our mini bar restocked. Had to mail a PRE-PAID package while there and went to concierge, who instructed us to go to the business center where we were charged 10.00 just for them to take the package (already in bag, labeled and pre-paid the shipping). This is not the high end service of one of Vegas’ top hotels. When paying Bellagio prices you expect high-end service and that’s not the case. I was so disappointed with my luxury accommodations."
1693,3.0,A lot of noisy at the morning.,We heard a lot of noisy from the next door or the hallway. The soundproofed of room was not satisfy. Every morning we could hear kids' screaming or dog barking that noisy wake us up. We also could hear someone slided the door.
1694,4.0,"Managed to get a Fountainview room, pay for this extra benefit, worth it!","Managed to get a Fountainview room, pay for this extra benefit, worth it! Originally checked in through the app, it put us in a smoking room and downgraded us, called the front desk and they gladly upgraded us to a Fountainview room, if you are able to do this, well worth it, the views are spectacular. The hotel itself is in great shape, but very very crowded, we found that the Luxor, had just as nice an environment, and was much less busy. I recommend getting a three day pass for the deuce, it is well worth the money, used it to go up and down the strip all the way on both ends. Allowed us to get to the pinball museum, welcome sign, my museum, Fremont Street, and all the casinos on the strip. Had a bit of rain one afternoon, so we just sat on the bus and took it and to end."
1695,4.0,Good but not the best,"Compared to other five star hotels there is much they can improve on and add to make it a much better experience. Still it was a pleasant stay but as I visited nearby hotels I realized there is more to enjoy. Fountains were amazing, the convenience to the cirque de soleil show and to the strip was great also."
1696,5.0,Excellent Service,"We had purchased transportation to and from the airport. Both times the drivers were very friendly. The lady at the check-in counter was excellent. I had to wait for my room since we landed at 7am. The called me when the room was ready. Once I got back to the desk, there were several people waiting to be helped. The woman that checked me in noticed me and handed me my room key so I wouldn't have to wait longer. Room was clean and nice (2 bedroom penthouse). No issues and the staff was very helpful."
1697,5.0,Luxurious and beautiful,"If you are looking for comfort, beauty, elegance, convenience, and relaxing this place is for your. The hotel provides excellent view. There’s plenty of high end shopping and entertainment is top notch. Walking distance to other nearby hotels for a different vibe and endless entertainment… It’s also family friendly."
1698,4.0,20 year anniversary,Had the best time staff was very welcoming Resort was very tidy Can’t wait to go back Largo and spargo were some of the best dishes we have ever had Staff was amazing Pools were unreal So relaxing Best time of year to go
1699,4.0,Iconic,"We stayed here in a fountain view king room and it did not disappoint! The room itself was spacious with a massive bathroom and modern decor throughout. The bed was really comfortable and we particularly enjoyed the electronically controlled drapery which revealed the stunning view of the fountains and Vegas strip. It was truly the best view in Vegas and something you take for granted....we didn't want to leave the room! The rest of the hotel/casino is (as expected) luxurious throughout with some stunning restaurants and a vast casino floor with loads of choice if you fancy a flutter. The pool area is paradisaical with several pools to choose from, lots of beds (if you're up and out early enough) and a couple of decent bars/cafes that serve decent food and cocktails. A few"
1700,5.0,Table Dealers / pit boss,Absolutely the nicest dealers and pit bosses. Bellagio is a classy establishment. We come to Vegas once a year and only stay at the Bellagio because the service is truely remarkable. Tony P is the best. He resolved a table conflict courteously and respectfully even to people who aren’t.
1701,2.0,"Smoke, smoke, and more smoke","From the moment we arrived it was terrible. Enter lobby filled with smoke and waited in long line to checkin on a Tuesday. Finally get to someone and told our room isn’t ready even though checkin was at 3 and we arrived after 3. Were told it was being cleaned and a “rush” was put on it and we were need to wait. No place to sit and it was so smokey so we hauled our luggage to back area of hotel toward tram to escape the smoke and finally found a chair. No way in hell we’re we leaving our bags with bell hop with thousands of dollars in luxury goods and jewelry in it. An hour and a half later, are room is ready. Then haul our luggage back to lobby to get key, then the trek thru the even smokier casino to our room. Take a foot off elevator on Stay Well floor and I step in fresh gum"
1702,5.0,"Friendly staff, beautiful place","Staff was extremely friendly, hotel was nice & clean. Room was spacious and the bathroom was spoiling! The pools are truly amazing, relaxing and peaceful! Table games were too expensive, nothing less than $25….that’s my only complaint."
1703,5.0,Excellent,"Check in was speedy. Rooms were cleaned on a timely basis. Casino was cleaned often. Showers were nice in the room but not enough space for your shampoo, etc. Also very hard to shave your legs if you are a woman no where to put your leg up."
1704,5.0,Awesome,I could not ask for more from a classic hotel and casino! The staff was very helpful and even gave me complimentary parking witch saved me so much money! Thanks to them for helping me out without any questions asked!
1705,5.0,Weekend Getaway,The hotel is beautiful and dining at Prime was amazing with views of the fountains. So many Amazing places to shop and located central to all of the happenings on the strip. We plan to visit again in July.
1706,4.0,Overall a great place to stay!,"My favourite hotel on the strip and I've stayed at many. It's clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are well appointed, large, cleaned regularly and the beds are super comfy. The pool is also kept clean and there are lots of loungers and towels!"
1707,4.0,"Solid hotel, but not perfect","Check-in process was agonizing. Did mobile check-in so I could “skip the line,” but then ended up still having to stand in line. Booked a fountain view room, but windows were too dirty to clearly see the show. Music from TV was also not synced properly, making the fountain show just a show with music in the background."
1708,4.0,Nice stay poor housekeeping,??????????????????????????????????????????????????Resort is nice but housekeeping is very poor and prices on amenities are way to high. We will stay here again. If conditions are improved on guest service and maybe give a little more value to the middle guy who works hard for there money
1709,5.0,Very enjoyable stay,Fountain view rooms are the best. You can kick back watch the show while listening to the music on the tv. Great central location on the strip. Pool is wonderful but can be crowded. Lots of restaurants on the property and near by.
1710,5.0,Great service. Great team.,"Overall experience was fantastic. No problems checking in, none checking out. Staff was friendly, courteous, and overly helpful. Location is perfect for what we wanted to do in Vegas. Definitely a spot we’d love to stay at again."
1711,5.0,Bellagio still going strong,Our 3 night stay at the Bellagio did not disappoint. Our fountain view room was great. The air conditioner had a hard time keeping up at times but we kept the curtains closed when we were away. Ate at Mayfair and Spago this stay and they were great as well. Bellagio is a super quick walk to the crystal shops or even tram ride. Would recommend the Bellagio for its overall commitment to quality and comfort.
1712,4.0,Dont use public restrooms,"Not one time in 4 days did I walk into a casino area restroom that I didnt walk out disgusted. Finally learned my lesson and went back to my room to use the toilet. Great room, restaurants, and service (except you will die of old age waiting for a coffee in the casino in the morning)."
1713,3.0,I expected better.,"This was my first stay at the Bellagio. The room appeared super nice, and every staff person I encountered was kind and helpful and cheerful. There was lots to do and eat inside the casino, so we didn’t have much needed to leave. Unfortunately, my room was not cleaned very well. There was hair in my sink, in my shower, and on my pillows. I found dried urine on my toilet seat and something resembling coffee splashed on my closet door. I understand that the housekeeping staff are under tremendous pressure to turn over these rooms quickly; but when you pay so much for a room that seems so luxurious, you expect it to be impeccably cleaned. And I have experience in hospitality, cleaning hotel rooms myself, and I know it is possible not to leave hairs and fluids behind. I wish there"
1714,5.0,Best place to stay,Pretty clean and nice place to stay. Location was great as everything is in walking distance. The water show was awesome. Hotel was gorgeous. I would recommend this location to everyone who would like to enjoy relaxing in LV.
1715,4.0,Another great stay.,"Spent five days and had a great time. Checkin was fast and pleasant. Only a few snags. Little bummed that I had to pay $30 extra for a room with two beds. It used to be the same as a king room. Food options still just okay for late night, places closing way too early for a busy hotel on a weekend. Ordered cocktails and chips and salsa at the pool on my last day 4/18. Drinks took awhile and chips took almost an hour which was ridiculous. Then the server proceeded to tell me all about how my actual server finally showed up, apparently she was late. And the girl had to cover two sections. As much as I feel bad for her, she really shouldn’t have told me all this and also should have checked back on us and looked into why our food took so long. The conservatory was gorgeous as"
1716,4.0,Pretty hotel,Guest services seem annoyed with question about late checkout costs . Never got room service . Hotel was beautiful though. Garden was amazing .Great location. Overall good experience. Staff could be friendlier
1717,4.0,Daughters Belated 21st Birthday.,"Majority of staff, very friendly and helpful. Hotel has most facilities available but no tea/coffee facilities in rooms.Casino huge. Swimming pool OK but very busy and sun beds difficult to get after 10.00 am. I found the food and drinks to be quite expensive. You should be aware of the room tax at $45 dollars per night, plus a tax on the room tax at circa $6 per night."
1718,1.0,Old Rooms & overprice hotel,"The rooms very ugly and old,all the restaurants super expensive,the buffet expensive and the food nothing exceptional.Never come back.In the minibar a coke has a price of $ 10.00 something very ridiculous for a hotel in this country, a very bad experience."
1719,5.0,Business Trip,"All the staff at the Bellagio were incredibly pleasant to work with. If you ever book a meeting, you will not be disappointed with the available meeting spaces and patio areas. The staff was available at a moment's notice and treat you like you are their only client."
1720,3.0,"Small rooms, bad water pressure and loud music","The hotel is beautiful, however, the rooms are small compared to other hotels for a similar price. The shower in my room was very roomy but I don't know if it was your water pressure or shower head that kept me from getting much water. It was beating to take a shower in there with such little water. I had a fountain-facing room that also faces the loud music being played at planet Hollywood until 4am! I was on the 16th floor and could hear the music playing...not a good thing."
1721,4.0,Birthday getaway,"Everything was almost perfect. The steakhouse was undergoing some renovations and could not make a reservation for my Birthday. Drawers were a little dusty in room, and the bell desk took 45 mins to get our luggage to the room. More casual dining or fast food places would be great for us night owls."
1722,5.0,Best location on the strip,"Centrally located on the West side of the strip, Bellagio has great access for a long-weekend to most of the attractions and restaurants that we wanted to visit. Staff was courteous and helpful. The tram allowed us to avoid the crowds, and provided cleaner and safer access to additional MGM properties."
1723,4.0,Beautiful Resort,"Fiancé and I selected to stay at the Bellagio because we never did and haven’t traveled since Covid restrictions and wanted to experience this high end resort. The resort is beautiful, spacious and clean, the beds are heavenly as well. Expect to walk a bit for the nearest Starbucks as well, I would have gave 5 stars for this visit but we were treated poorly on a specific day heading back to the spa tower- we were asked to present our room key and have it scanned by a staff member while others could utilize the scanner on wall. I felt my fiancé was being racially profiled and felt as if we didn’t fit the image. Other than this our experience was good."
1724,5.0,Amazing,"Bellagio is magnificent. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are wonderful and the staff is kind, friendly and welcoming. The casino is easy to navigate and very clean and welcoming. The conservatory is amazing as usual. The pools are fantastic. Bellagio is by far my favorite hotel in Las Vegas!"
1725,5.0,Best place ever!!!!!❤️,Fabulous view to the fountains!!! Great service everywhere in the resort!! It was our first time to Vegas and it was a blast!! Beautiful decor from the front doors to the room. Fountain view room is a must! Beautiful!!!
1726,5.0,Family fun,Everyone was very nice and polite the hotel was beautiful. The only problem for me was it was a long walk from my room to the casino They have very good restaurants. Something for everyone no matter what your test. I really enjoy my vacation at the Bellagio. And would definitely recommend it to everyone who wants to be pampered and by the way the pools are amazing
1727,5.0,Bellagio forever,"Las Vegas means Bellagio and no resort else! you wanna have a quality vacation in Las Vegas you have only one choice which is Bellagio, restaurants, bites, slots, table game, pools, all high-end and most important part high end stuff."
1728,3.0,Not the same,"Cafe is not 24 hours. Buffet is brunch only. Housekeeping is limited. Blackjack is now a 6 to 5 pay, not 1 1/2. Roulette table added a B to the mix. Now you have 0, 00, and B. Tipping odds more in favor of the house. A bit greedy !!"
1729,4.0,Bellagio,"Very nice. Expensive, of course. Our room had a view of the water show out front and was very nice to be able to look at after dark. Also the pool area is beautiful. Used the MGM app as a room key. I recommend getting a plastic card key because the room key part of the app was not 100% every time it was tried. All food on the facility is excellent."
1730,5.0,Superb service,"It was really nice to stay in bellagio as very good staff and so much fun . There is many things which we enjoyed in bellagio as shopping mall , Flower park really looks awesome and enjoy the casino also I got very a room with fantastic view and my kids are so excited to stay in bellagio and it’s fully worth"
1731,5.0,Great hotel,"Great strip location. Check in is always hassle-free. Staff pleasant and helpful. Love the variety of restaurants and our favorite dessert, after dinner retreat is Petrossian! Rooms are always well serviced and bathroom a great size. We usually stay in a Fountain view king and it is a good size, 510sq’"
1732,4.0,Return visit to our wedding venue,"We got married here in 2008 and returned this week for a 6 day stay. We had booked via AMEX Fine Hotel and Resorts and got a great deal with credit and some extra discounts. Checked in at 1.30 as early check in was included and no high rooms available and no upgrades available (one of the perks), we said we would be happy to wait and then all of a sudden 10 mins later a fountain view room available on the 12th floor which we were grateful for. We last stayed here in 2014 and the room decor had been updated then and then this stay it had changed again. I personally wasn't keen, lack of closet space, no tub and shower slow, no turndown service anymore, no sanitary sacks in room (not ideal when a lady has her cycle) and nothing even like cotton buds etc, slippers etc. Seemed"
1733,5.0,Superb visit. Thanks Belleagio. :),It was terrific. All the staff was helpful. The Premier King room was nice. Housekeeping kept in clean. I will definitely stay there again. Bellagio is a wonderful hotel. I would not have as nice a time in Las Vegas if I stayed in any other hotel.
1734,5.0,Great time!! Great Hotel/Casino,"We stayed at Bellagio for 3 nights. The Check in was super easy, all the staff we came in contact with were great. Friendly and seemed to genuinely wanted to make our stay a fun and wonderful experience. The pools are fantastic. Our pool attendant (and wish i paid more attention to her name) was super great. She moved to Vegas about 6 years ago and always had a smile and came by often and checked on us better than if we were family. Sasha, one of my 3 card poker dealers really stood out. She was efficient in her dealing, but really seemed to enjoy what she did and was happy to be there and doing what she does. Can't wait to go back!! There are less expensive places to stay in Vegas, but for the experience and comfort, the added price is worth it."
1735,5.0,A perfect spring getaway!!,"A truly great visit! Beautiful room, fantastic restaurants, stunning art & garden conservatory, and helpful, positive staff. The pool area is outstanding with clean, bright decor and spotless, warm water!"
1736,5.0,Get Away,Bellagio was great and we really enjoyed our stay. Love the rooms and the service we received from all staff. Hotel was in the center of the strip and we were able to walk to various hotels on daily basis. Will stay again.
1737,5.0,Funtimes,My room was amazing literally I could push a button above my bed and the drapes would open to the fountains absolutely beautiful. Shower was on point. Room service needs upgraded though. Casino needs a upgrade also very dead looming not inviting at all very dark.
1738,5.0,Spring visit to Las Vegas,Beautiful comfortable room with fountain view. All staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast at Sadelle's was a great start to the day. We always enjoy the gardens at the conservatory. We will definitely be back. 👍👍👍
1739,5.0,Beautiful and lovely experience,Great experience! I would definitely go back to that place. Plus it was a great experience. First time staying in a five-star hotel in America. I enjoyed it the pool room service on the 27th floor. Wonderful
1740,4.0,fun and expensive,"Hotel is beautiful but meals at Prime and their breakfast spot were out of this world over the top expensive. We all could not find a blackjack table for under $25.00 all vacation! We opted to go elsewhere. The ambiance is what made us come here and it did not disappoint. Rooms were lovely, clean and affordable. Even the bar at the pool charges outrageous prices. Ended up going to our friends pool where drinks were normal price."
1741,5.0,Great service,Great service from everyone…from the limo driver that picked us up to the VIP lounge arranging vehicles getting us reservations. Room was great service was great….we will be back soon!!! The Bellagio was great!!!
1742,5.0,Glad to Be Back at the Bellagio,"It has been three years since we have been to the Bellagio and what a return. It was like we never left. Grounds, spa, fitness center all kept extremely clean. The Garden this year was spectacular, a must see."
1743,2.0,Eh alright,"For winning a ""free"" room and it only suppose be charged $51 and ended up getting charged another $130 I'd say it was alright. Not as hyped up as they made it for ""upgrading"" the room to something newly renovated."
1744,5.0,Can't be outdone.,"This was my husband and my first trip together in Las Vegas. As soon as he suggested the idea, The Bellagio was already in my head. It's iconic, right? Well, he had another property in mind. I told him to trust me, and he ended up being so glad. We selected a fountain view room, and it was spectacular. On those days when you're late to get out of bed, or even when you want to have a calm evening on the Strip, a fountain view room is perfect. The music is available via television station, so it's a front row seat every time. The app made check-in, check-out, and room entry incredibly easy as well, though you should be sure to stop by the front desk if you book with a travel credit card, to ensure you claim all of your perks. We used bell services and gig drivers several times"
1745,3.0,Not worth the price,"The fountain didn’t work. The room has a wired noise every 3 mins like an airplane noise which when I addressed it to the front desk, nothing has been offered to me to solve the issue. It is not worth to stay in this hotel."
1746,1.0,Terrible,"Rooms are expensive, tables are expensive, someone else’s food was left in mini bar fridge upon arrival. Also, the slots rarely paid… blew close to $10k and won nothing. 24 hr dining was unavailable the night we were leaving and wanted steaks and whiskey. “Available options” gave us food poisoning."
1747,1.0,BEWARE noise from service elevators,"We were placed in room 9033. It appears it’s away from elevators, but it’s near excessively noisy service elevators. It sounds like you’re sleeping near a runway with takeoff every 5 minutes. When we asked to be moved the next morning, there were no apologies, no offers to be compensated. We asked later that day and they comped 1 day charge for resort fee and parking. You could not pay me to sleep in that room again. They should be ashamed to charge for it."
1748,4.0,Great Hotel.,"Great Hotel, restaurant’s, pool. God gaming areas, lounges and service. Pool was too crowded and not enough places to sit. Gaming area drinks services were slow Room was good but missing some bathroom items, tooth brush , tooth paste."
1749,5.0,Wonderful,"The botanical garden was the reason for our stay and it was excellent. Staff is 100% helpful, clean rooms, easy access to and from the strip and a ton of things to see within walking distance. Great stay"
1750,5.0,Weekend getaway,Best weekend ever. Everything was superb. Pool was relaxing. Restaurants were mouth watering. Drinks were delicious. Room was stunning. View was incredible. Could not have asked for more. Only complaint was room service not easy to get ahold of and food was mediocre when we finally got it. But otherwise great stay! We will be back!
1751,5.0,Vacation stop over for.,Check in was a breeze. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. The room was very clean and more than we expected. Although our stay was short we thoroughly enjoyed our visit as we always do. We will be back.
1752,5.0,This place is actually magical!👍,Absolutely wonderful! We had the best time. This place is actually magical! I would highly recommend! The pools are gorgeous and the casino is spectacular! And the rooms are to die for… we’ll definitely be back!
1753,5.0,Great Vegas getaway!,"It was wonderful. Everyone at Bellagio was very hospitable. When asking directions, we were helped by one of your goodwill embassadors, Vyeheth Tith, who even comped us $50 for breakfast. Amazing. The room was lovely, with a view of the fountains. We had a terrific time. Can’t even complain about the slots. Played a lot—won and lost. Came home with a little money! 😳😊. All in all, a great time."
1754,5.0,Was a great resort,"Had a cypress suite! It was fantastic, and we weee treated well. Can’t believe a room of this cost has NO coffee machine! NO fridge! NO water? Water is a nickel at cost🙈The fountain view is incredible"
1755,5.0,The best hotel on Las Vegas strip,"The hotel is clean ,check in was quick Stay well room was great The experience was wonderful , one of the best Hotel on the strip Very walkable to most places The Rose theme at the conservatory is amazing."
1756,4.0,Beautiful Safe Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Bellagio. This was our first trip back to Las Vegas since Covid. We wanted a place where we would feel safe. The Bellagio was wonderful. We were disappointed that the Fitness Center was not open at 6am. We also had to walk to Caesar's for coffee before 7am. That being said, we brought breakfast up from the Bellagio Patisserie each morning (again, unfortunately not until 7am) that was delicious and we ordered room service for dinner Friday night which hit the spot. We had a lovely room on the west side so we were able to have a glass of wine and watch the sun set over the mountains while our adult daughter went off to The Backstreet Boys concert."
1757,5.0,"Amazing Hotel. Great Service, Great Pool, Great Rooms, Beautiful Fountains Cleanleness!👍","Great Hotel, Great Hospitality, Wonderful Ambiance in the rooms, Friendly Staff, Great Restaurant’s,Bars, Shops, Pools, Service!! Just a great overall experience every time I visit. Recommended to all!"
1758,5.0,Fun Bellagio trip with a buddy!,"Had a great time spending a couple nights at the Bellagio with a buddy. Doug at the bar at Prime made helped to make it special. Great steak dinner with lots of fun stories and laughs topped off with a couple glasses of Dame Mas. The GM, Aron even stopped by to visit and make sure everything was perfect. We are not high rollers but Doug and Aron made us feel like we were. Thanks!!"
1759,1.0,Disappointing service,"I was on my honeymoon, and I entered the room and found out a pair of socks under the window from previous customer and carpet wasn’t clean at all, I called room service and they hanged up the first time. The second time they asked the housekeeping team to remove the socks and clean the room they came after 30 min. So I spent 1 hour waiting this issue to be fixed"
1760,5.0,Nice rooms and awesome pools!!,Great rooms and awesome pools. Will be going back for sure to donate more money to there casino…Maybe others will be more lucky then I was either way it was a blast there. Would love to do the shows they have there again also.
1761,5.0,Director of Sales,I haven't been back to the Bellagio for almost two years. We usually come for events like AFSA and MBA events. I passed the last couple years didn't want to stay at Bellagio due to an incident that happened on my last conference. I had chosen to stay at another hotel and then come to the event only. I reported my incident the day I checked out and thought I would hear from some one. I woke up about 4 am to use the bathroom and apparently the glass shower door didn't close all the way it was dark I walked into the bathroom and busted my eye and forehead on the door. I had a huge black eye the next morning and had two more days at the event with black eye and a cut on my eyebrow. I reported it when I checked out. I told them if it was an elderly person it could of been more
1762,5.0,The BEST!,"Beautiful environments with a photo shot zone at the front of the garden area. The kindly staff, enough tables for craps,& blackjack tables, ... Love it!!!! It makes me feel like a beautiful vacation place."
1763,5.0,Vacation before spring break,"Enjoyed every experience. Really enjoyed the Tram. The room is always spectacular. Only, had one bad experience my in room breakfast order took 80 minutes to deliver. But once it did come best breakfast I had."
1764,5.0,Bellagio Penthouse is a MUST,2 bedroom penthouse was freaking amazing. It is definitely worth the money and experience. It was facing the fountains and the bow at night is completely amazing. Service is top notch. The garden is amazing and the food unbelievable.
1765,5.0,Great Experience.,Room was clean. The casino floor is excellent. My partner and I really enjoyed spending time by the pool. We only tried Prime steakhouse but it was one of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had. Let’s not forget that the Bellagio is close to everything. Will be coming back soon!
1766,4.0,The beautiful Bellagio,"I love this hotel having stayed here in 2010 for our wedding. It took 12 years to get back and today is our last night at this beautiful hotel. We again stayed in a fountain view room, it’s a must. Managed to get a late check out tomorrow as we have an evening flight. 3pm at a cost of 60 dollars. Later would have been in the hundreds. The hotel is very busy this weekend. Check in was busy on arrival but reception were quick, helpful and very friendly. On arrival into our fountain view room the hair dryer didn’t work and one of the sinks didn’t empty. Both issues were quickly resolved by house keeping. Our room wasn’t cleaned till day 3 of our stay hence the 4 stars not 5. There’s no bath tub and the shower is a trickle. Aside from these things the room is lovely. Be"
1767,5.0,Consistently excellent,"We visit Bellagio during each trip to Las Vegas. This time we stayed, celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. It was everything we expected, save for a poor dining experience at Lago. Otherwise, we remain extremely satisfied and will return again to enjoy this crown jewel of the Las Vegas Strip."
1768,5.0,Best Casino to visit in Vegas,"try visiting different places in Vegas for 30 years, over all espects ,this place is the best to stay and have fun. worth the money to spend here then any other places. garden is extreamly beautiful too."
1769,5.0,Great stay,"Standard room was great. Fresh, clean and felt large and luxurious. All the food we had on property was amazing. Pool was crowded but nice and relaxing. We went to many casinos on our trip and the Bellagio was our favorite. Such beautiful grounds. Great location. Would stay here again and again."
1770,1.0,Not worth your money,Booked a room at stay well but the filter needs to be replace and the shower infuser is empty. There is also a hair in our bed and had to call the housekeeping to change it. The small water on their vending machine costs $8. It's too pricey. Doesn't mean you book at Bellagio you will get the best hotel experience. To be honest I would never stay there again. I loved MGM Grand and Mandalay.
1771,3.0,Noisy..traffic,"Constant construction noise in our room made it difficult to sleep. It sounded like it was coming from a jack hammer. Also, 3 lanes fronting the hotel (in front of the fountains) were closed at all times causing major traffic to get into the hotel. Wasted my money."
1772,3.0,Charge for everything,"Obviously it’s a nice hotel in a great location, but so many extra fees and little benefits. Resort fee, parking fee, Ref fee no in room coffee. Basic items for all other hotels No room Ref. No microwave. No coffee Then the gambling tables were all too pricey"
1773,5.0,Sisters get away,Beautiful hotel. Some of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in at a hotel. Friendly staff. Long lines at all the hotel restaurants but the food was good. Room service was excellent. Fun place for a short get away.
1774,3.0,Unexpected,"I work in the resort industry, I deliver excellent customer service, I work really hard, so for my between season break the Bellagio was a big treat for me. I had just spent 3 nights at the Mandalay Bay, was shocked that my room had the last guest's sock, hair tie and soap scum on the bathroom counter and side of the bath, but it wasn't the Bellagio and I was expecting the MBay disappointment to be forgotten with a Bellagio visit. At both hotels I had the basic room, booked through the MGM Rewards process, I'm not a gambler I had enrolled as I usually use Priceline, when I woke up the first morning in the Bellagio room I was shocked that there were crumbs between the beds, the bedside table drawer handle ledge had sticky group and confetti in it, there were crumbs under the"
1775,5.0,Vacation,Staying at the Bellagio was a wonderful experience. It was a complementary three night stay which was wonderful. Outstanding service. A bit pricey but that’s to be expected. Plenty to do. I just wish that they would have more tables open under $25 limits.
1776,2.0,Overpriced and overrated,"Overpriced for having a bathroom that is outdated and showed wear and tear. The hotel restaurants food are average but extremely expensive. We are travelers and compare to other hotels we’ve been, Bellagio is simply overrated."
1777,5.0,Western trip,My husband and I took a trip out west and stopped in Vegas. We stayed at belligio it is a beautiful casino and we stayed in a stay well room which was comfortable and very attractive. The casino was roomy and well 🔥
1778,5.0,Always good.,Property is great. Stay three times a year and it’s always great the staff is amazing. Restaurants are good. Get you in and out. The buffet is always quality food. The conservatory is beautiful. No reason to try anywhere else
1779,4.0,A Beautiful Place,"The Bellagio has always been a favorite place to stay, and its apparent freshening up has made it even more beautiful. That said, the facelift apparently cost a lot of money, for the cost of everything at the hotel has risen dramatically since before Covid. The total charge for two large size drinks at the pool was $86. The resort fee is $45 each night and the valet is $35 each night. They have also changed one of the pools to an exclusive area costing $175 for a cushioned lounge chair, a guaranteed table and umbrella, and no kids. It will be difficult to justify staying here more often, but it is a lovely experience."
1780,5.0,I really like the hotel,It was a great experience. I was comfortable and was able to relax. I went for BTS concert. They had goodies for Army. The housekeeping was great and the customer service was very helpful. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.
1781,5.0,Best stay on the Strip.,"My boyfriend and I enjoy staying at the Bellagio that best. The Bellagio is the most beautiful hotel, amazing food, and great location. I always feel at home at the Bellagio. We enjoyed the scenery Belligo has, best breakfast at Sadelles, and drinks at the Piano bar."
1782,3.0,Nice Rooms But Horrible Experience Overall,Had problems getting the MGM app set up so I could use bypass check-in and use the digital key. The TV wasn't working when I arrived and had to wait for maintenance to get it fixed. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor. A Reuben sandwich and water cost $43 from room service.
1783,5.0,Bellagio Stay,Absolutely the best experience. All the staff was incredible. They truly rolled out the red carpet from start to finish. Very clean. Beautiful property! They made me feel like I was a movie star for the day/night! Highly recommend!
1784,1.0,Don't wasste your hard earned money staying at the Bellagio.,"The room we got for the price we paid was ridiculous. We paid $698 a night for a room with 2 beds, 1 chair and a small table that only one person could sit at. The bathtub did not have any hot hot water and it took 2 days and numerous calls to guest services to get it fixed. The charge an additional $45 for a resort fee on top of the $698 a night for a pool that you could never use because it was over crowded. There was only a minibar fridge that I put a bottle of water that I bought to get cold so my daughter could take her medicine. They ended up charging me $22 for it because it was weight that was removed from the fridge. We asked if we could get a fridge and they were happy to provide one for $50 day. We joined the MGM reward to take advantage of a $75 per day"
1785,5.0,Great hotel,"Beautiful place, comfortable room ,huge area to explore never a dull moment at the Bellagio.Our experience was fantastic and memorable.scenic and unbelievably fantastic!! Will definitely be visiting again ."
1786,5.0,“Fabulous” can be found at the Bellagio,"Staff, hotel, and rooms are absolutely Fabulous at the Bellagio. There really is no need to leave the property, there’s entertainment/shows, great blackjack tables, and fine dining, as well as casual dining. This is the Classiest and Best place to stay when in Las Vegas. Look no further! ❤️"
1787,2.0,Overpriced - Would not recommend.,"Was told we had a $75/day food and beverage credit only to learn upon check-out we did not. As such, we spent about that amount each day. Not only did we not have the credit, there’s a $45/day “resort fee” they charge you. Pool closed at 6pm each day. All dining options on-site were overpriced for the quality. Would not return not recommend."
1788,5.0,Old School luxury,"For Las Vegas, this property is tastefully understated. It has a vibe that is completely different from most of the properties on the strip. It actually reminds me more of a European destination than the resorts on the strip that consciously try to mimic other destinations."
1789,5.0,Best Hotel on the strip,I have been coming to Vegas for 40 years. I started out staying at the Luxor. It was fine but I was offered a stay at the other MGM properties. I chose Bellagio and will never look back! The quality is the very best!
1790,3.0,Disappointed ☹️,Charged twice for my stay and housekeeping was notified not to enter the entirety of my stay and they entered two days in a row. The hotel is beautiful and the room was nice as well as the food. The billing and housekeeping was a huge disappointment.
1791,5.0,Great Hotel Long Walk,"The hotel was nice. The room was nice. Getting from the strip to the hotel and then from the main hotel to our room was a hike. The hotel was very secure. The pool was nice and we enjoyed that there was a hot tub, many chairs and free water."
1792,5.0,Vegas,Bellagio is the Absolute best place too stay…super classy and they take care of you…that is why I choose it every single time I go….they have exceptional service and excellent customer service ….thank you again bellagio for giving us the best time over and over and over
1793,5.0,Beautiful hotel and amazing staff,"All staff were amazing and always helpful! Lots and lots of traffic through the building but it wasn’t much of an issue. Food was good, room was amazing. Lots of beautiful pools to spend time at and the casino was always busy!"
1794,5.0,A great experience!,Had to do last minute change of plans and booked a couple of nights at the Bellagio while In Vegas. The staff was able to accommodate us in the room we wanted in less than an hour. Check-in was a breeze. The room was implacable and very cozy. We were fascinated by the views and we could watch the fountain’s spectacle has many times as we wanted from the room. The pool area was great plus you could have breakfast there too. Staff was polite and attentive. The hotel grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. Will definitely come back!
1795,1.0,Horrible all around,"Drink service was not existent while playing slots. Would maybe get one drink after an hour and having to ask a worker on the floor. Sat and played video poker twice and both times the bartenders were more concerned with talking to the other employees. Room was dirty, room service took 30 minutes longer than quoted each time. Had $100 comp and it was no taken off so I had to call after my trip to have them credit. All in all a horrible experience for such a high end casino."
1796,5.0,5 stars,"Love the Bellagio. The rooms are clean, housekeeping is great. The casino is well ventilated. Location is great. The flower garden is beautiful. The fountains are beautiful. And the pool was beautiful!"
1797,2.0,Undervalued,We had to move rooms to the main tower due to an issue with booking from the spa tower. After we packed everything up for our 6 night stay we proceeded to trek through the casino to the main tower no help no assistance and not once ever asked. When I requested assistance I was told to go outside and ask one of the bell boys....? So there going to come to my room move us and I have to ask...I felt odd in doing so. Once we arrived there was a bit of a smell from the drains in the room. Also the sinks kept clugging like water was draining. The smell from the drains kept getting worse. The sound also continued throughout the stay mainly worse in the morning which was so loud you could hear through the bathroom door. I had consistent issues with my room card entering the parking
1798,5.0,"A favorite hotel with their excellent customer service, amenities, shows, and scrumptious food! Lots of restaurants to","It’s a must experience Hotel! Excellent customer service! Clean and beautiful surroundings. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Lots of high-end shopping places. Great shows to watch, especially Cirque Du Soleil “O”. Fast and reliable housekeeping staff, front desk, members card customer Service, with very helpful and informative people. Comfy beds and pillows. Love the pool! Don’t forget the gelato! Can’t wait to come back again soon! Thank you!"
1799,5.0,Best place in Las Vegas to stay!,I really love the rooms and the beautiful designs throughout the building. Heaven on earth! Great price for the quality of service and the decor! 8 stars. My entire wedding party and majority of my guest stayed here for my wedding on April 16th 2022
1800,3.0,Borahegas,"Went to see BTS and stayed at Bellagio. Location was good, fountains beautiful, but rooms need to be updated. Look old and dated (however bathrooms nice). Also Casino was very, very smokey and had to walk through to get to room. I know all the Casino's except for Park MGM allow smoking, but I went to Mandalay Bay and walked through Casino and it did not smell as smokey as Bellagio. It was a real turn off. I've stayed at nice Hotels...the Huntley in Santa Monica, Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas and The Palms Regent and Seven Stars in Turks & Caicos. Bellagio my least favorite and frankly wish I had explored other options like the Wyn, Aria, etc. But might not have liked them, because frankly don't like Vegas...only went because of BTS."
1801,3.0,Great view,The view from the suites are amazing i think I was in room 30016 and it was very nice. The rooms looks amazing. My only issue and why i gave 3 out of 5 is because they gave me a suite that was offered and I was upgraded too was the shower it the tile at the door was broken and the shower glass door traped my wife in the shower did not call for assitance as it was embarrassing to have anyone come help while my wife is naked and locked in the shower luckily it opened somehow and didnt have to call anyone. Besides the shower door locking my wife in the room was very nice along woth the view and the bed was comfy.
1802,2.0,"AC not working well, reported, no feedback.","We were looking forward to staying at the Bellagio since it is considered a 5 star. We were disappointed because the room AC was not cold. The hallway was cooler than our room even if it was set to 60. We reported it no feedback, nothing. We also had to call both days to have our room cleaned. Both days they did not do it while we were away for the day. Great location, great pool. Did not live up to reputation."
1803,5.0,"1st Class Service, 5 Star Experience","Very popular location. Casino smells of cigarette smoke. All other areas are exceptional. Security is 10 out of 10, facility 10 out of 10, rooms 10 out of 10, service 10 out of 10, room service 10 out of 10. If you are looking for a exceptional experience without having to leave the property, the Bellagio has it all!"
1804,5.0,Want the best? It’s at bellagio,"From concierge services, front desk, house keeping , host, bellagio is top notch. Will stay here anytime! Staff were super friendly! Fountain show from our room were spectacular. It’ll be hard to beat bellagio! Stay here if you want the best!"
1805,3.0,Could be better!,"We had one of the renovated rooms which was lovely and had an amazing view overlooking the fountains, which are super impressive! However, for being a revamped room, the shower was pathetic and was similar to a garden sprinkler! The hotel in general is nice but had a really mouldy smell in all the common areas and hallways. It seemed it would benefit from a deep clean. The cafes are not set up to accommodate the volume of people in this hotel, long queues for breakfast every day! The poolside staff were great though, very attentive, fun and friendly! Best part of our stay in the hotel."
1806,3.0,Room with a view of water - but not the fountains.,"I reserved our room on the Bellagio website. After watching some video of the fountain show, there was a link to reserve a room with a view of the fountains: ""Rooms & Suites with Fountain View Options."" I clicked the link and reserved a ""Resort Tower King"" room. We were given a room with a view of water -- the swimming pools -- nowhere near the fountains."
1807,5.0,Weekend in Vegas,We love the location of the Bellagio. It’s close to a lot of shopping and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and we had a fountain view which was always entertaining. Don’t miss eating at Michael Mina’s at the hotel. Superb!
1808,3.0,needs improvement,main reasons for only 3 stars are the ridiculous $50 (with tax) daily resort fee and lack of coffee maker in room. The latter wouldn't be a big deal except there are only 2 small places to get coffee and each have 20+ minute lines all day long
1809,4.0,"Crowded for Spring Break BUT quiet, clean and comfortable room","We ended our Utah road trip in Las Vegas. This was our first stay at the Bellagio. It was super crowded due to Spring Break. However, once in our room, it was quiet, comfortable and just what we needed after the trekking through 5 national parks."
1810,3.0,"Unwelcoming, Expensive and IMO, far from the nicest on the strip.",While it is known as 1 of the best. We hardly thought so. It was one of the busiest Hotels on the strip. Something we did not experience at any other Hotel on the strip and we walked through most of them. The staff was somewhat friendly but they ALL had their hands out looking for tips on already over inflated prices. Buying water at the store in the hotel does not require a tip. But they sure did think so. This was across Vegas so not just the Bellagio. But there they seemed upset if you did not tip them. We had to call to have our room towels changed. We came back after a long day to find that we had no dry towels and the bed not made. Which the bed is fine but no dry towels was not. They did send someone every day after that but we should not have had to bring it up. The
1811,2.0,Not the Bellagio from years past.,"Not the old Bellagio when you were a ""guest."" We had to have a reservation to eat at any restaurant. The bed sheets were stiff and crunchy. The room's A/C was noisy and the door shook every time the people across from us closed their door."
1812,3.0,You're Paying for the Name,"The room was comparable to the standard rooms at Golden Nugget, New York New York, and Treasure Island. The furniture and walls were damaged. The ceiling above the shower was bubbling and paint was peeling. The room wasn't clean like I would expect the Bellagio would be (nooks and crannies had dust, there was blood on the top left of the mirror and near the bath that we didn't see until our last day). We just weren't impressed."
1813,5.0,"The ""Belle"" of the Strip","The most beautiful property on the strip...inside and out. Dining at Lago restaurant is ""magical,"" but no matter what ""season"" it is, the courtyard themed decorations are EXQUISITE and changed with the seasons. Can't say enough...I've stayed at 5 major hotels on the strip and at Bellagio for 3 visits... It's my only go-to resort anymore."
1814,1.0,Too Much Frustration,Digital room key failure and room service that never delivered - had to drive off property to find restaurant due to lines of people waiting. Certainly not worth the price I paid per night. Traffic was horrible. Very frustrating.
1815,5.0,A gorgeous stay in this grand hotel,"Simply the best sleep I have ever had. Ever. Such a grand hotel, if possible, please visit! The bathroom was glorious and the bed was huge. The hotel lobby had relatively fast check in but we did wait a bit longer than other prominent hotels. Still no complaint though. Very helpful and friendly staff. Casino has a great atmosphere. It made our visit to Vegas very special :) beautiful fountains, has to be done! Some great photo opportunities!"
1816,5.0,Bellagio is my favorite!,"I really like the bellagio. We’ve stayed at a few others on the strip but like bellagio best. Why? For one it’s dead center of the strip, there’s so much to do and you never have to leave the bellagio to have a good time. Plenty of restaurants- shopping - Starbucks - the fountains - conservatory - spa and amazing pools. And if you like to gamble of course there’s plenty of tables and slots to do that. We stayed in the spa tower queen suite. It’s nice having a separate living area to unwind in. It was a little noisy since we were on the freeway side but I always have my white noise machine with me. There are 3 sep bathrooms with 1 being a toilet and sink. We will always choose bellagio over the other hotels. It never disappoints!"
1817,5.0,Stay at the Bellagio.,The Bellagio is a very upscale resort and the service provided was up to caliber. The breakfast at Sadelles is also very delicious. The location is superb. The room was very comfortable. Fantastic stay
1818,4.0,Catching up with a friend,We stayed at a room in the Spa Tower. Very nice room overlooking the fountains and Paris across the street. The price of meals was terribly expensive - $50 for the buffet as well as exorbitant prices in most of the other restaurants as well. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Shout out to Vycheth Tith who took the time to help us find our way through the casino and share a few laughs. Would have liked to hang out with him for awhile.
1819,5.0,WE LOVE BELLAGIO!!!,"We never get disappointed with Bellagio! From service, room, food, table games and etc …just PERFECT! Also the decor and flowers are always so beautiful and smells gorgeous! This is the hotel my husband and I got married at and we are so glad we made that choice! :)"
1820,4.0,Great Accommodations with a Few Avoidable Miscues,"We paid for the benefit of a fountain room and the fountain was not operational, but no acknowledgement of the issue or offer to address it occurred. In addition, when the patio was closed due to high winds, our reservation for breakfast was cancelled with no attempt to notify us so we could make other arrangements. Finally, we waited in line for 35 minutes for a late-night meal at Snacks. When we got to the front of the line, we discovered that the items we wished to order had been out of stock for hours. A simple update to the reader board or sign would have prevented this. So...wonderful accommodations, but a few entirely avoidable miscues."
1821,4.0,Quick getaway,Bellagio is a wonderful place to stay. Room was great and bed was super comfortable. A little disappointed with the technology setup of room. They still have the extremely outdated 30 pin adapter for original iPhone. Our room did not have any USB ports
1822,5.0,Safe!!! Compared to the other resorts,"My stay was nice. It was worth a little extra money to know your staying in a safe place. I took my girls out here for the BTS concert and they loved the hotel. The only downside is the traffic/parking but hey what do you expect, it’s Vegas."
1823,5.0,Resort Relaxation,"We decided to take a quick Spring trip for relaxation and a break from the weather ups and downs from our hometown. The Bellagio did not disappoint. We had a view of the strip an a lovely room. Great food, crafted cocktails, wonderful service, and the beauty of the property added to our satisfaction. We got the break we were looking for and the relaxtion we needed."
1824,5.0,Excellent hotel,"Excellent room, great service, nice view of swimming pool, high floors, perfect location in the strip The room isn’t very sound proof, which is a bit of a let down given how much we paid for the room."
1825,3.0,Nice place; too many lines,Lines for coffee and food venues made this stay a bit frustrating. Couldn’t find coffee early in the morning (6am) without at least a 15 min wait in line. Restaurants all require reservations and are booked solid. Some were closed making the supply even scarcer.
1826,5.0,Beautiful hotel with excellent customer service!,Absolutely the best hotel on the strip! Location is perfect and close to everything! Top rated restaurants with delicious food and service! The Bellagio goes above and beyond to please their guests….exceptional!
1827,3.0,Maybe our expectations were too high,"We were on the 9th floor right above the villas. One of the villas had a party going on until 3:30AM and we got close to no sleep that night. We were able to switch to a higher floor next day but I had to miss a tour to the Hoover Dam to deal with it. Not to mention I was tired and cranky all day due to the lack of sleep. It was nice to be able to see the fountain shows from our new room on the 25th floor but it would have been a lot more pleasurable if the windows weren't as dirty as they were. There were other little things like the bathroom door that wouldn't shut, or just 3 towels available (had to call and had extras delivered promptly, no issues there, but then again - I had to call and ask) that made me regret the choice of the hotel. Like I said in the title to the"
1828,5.0,Service at the Bellagio Pool,"On Thursday, April 14th, my husband and I spend several hours at the Bellagio Pool. Our server, Danielle Renee, was friendly, courteous and efficient. Our experience that day, was the beginning of a fabulous vacation."
1829,5.0,Vegas,"The room was spacious, clean, comfortable, modern. The staff were very helpful and polite. The fountain was pretty cool to watch as well. I would definitely stay there agin if I ever went back to Vegas."
1830,1.0,Terrible EVERYTHING,"Booked through AMEX PLATINUM and hotel was not prepared for us, waited over 6 hours for suite, not given our strip view room, room was filthy when we finally got it. Not given our breakfast for 2 everyday, or our $100 room service credit, spent almost $1000 a night and treated like crap"
1831,1.0,Housekeeper stole $2k in cash when we asked for do not disturb,"We are in town for a BTS concert, we booked the penthouse suite for 2 nights and did not want our room cleaned. The housekeeping staff kept lurking around our door with the do not disturb sign on. Another staff member met me in the hall when I left for the elevators and insisted she send someone to clean the room. I told her she could take the trash by the desk please. We returned from the concert to find our room completely touched over and moved around with $2k in cash STOLEN from a black pack. Please be aware when considering the Bellagio! Theft seems rampant here"
1832,5.0,"The best ever, thank you!","Clean, spacious, comfortable room. Most of all, above and beyond customer service. Fountain View was awesome. Beautiful garden and very centralized, convenient location. It was an amazing stay. Thank you!"
1833,1.0,I don’t get the attraction,"There are far better rooms at most other hotels for the money. I’m actually blown away that they get return guests . Don’t do it ! We were also put in a 7th floor room sold as fountain view. This is a lie. Maybe “partial” if you consider seeing just the very tops of fountain, no lake, and some rooftops a view . Further , the room amenities and structure of the room is sub par for the price ."
1834,5.0,Simply Beautiful and Impressive Hotel,"Our early morning long and scenic walk ended up at the Bellagio Las Vegas on this very chilly morning. We toured the beautiful Lobby area and the marvelous and impressive Atrium neaby. We took the opportunity to take some beautiful photos. After being awed and overwhelmed by all the decorations, we engaged some sessions with many of the slot machines. Unfortunately, these slot machines were not user friendly - I guess that's why they are often referred to as ""one-Armed Bandits""."
1835,4.0,Terrible Check-out service,"The employee at check-out was extremely rude and not helpful. I attempted to ask her a question. She told me to get in line, even though there was no one in line. Seconds later a couple walked up, and she attended them, leaving me standing in line. Rude and unprofessional."
1836,5.0,Excellent Stay at the Bellagio,"Great Hotel, perfect location on the strip. Restaurants, Lounges, Gambling and Fountain Showsnwere excellent. Customer service was above and beyond. Rewards program is easy to work with. Looking forward to my next visit."
1837,5.0,Bellagio Stay,"I have stayed at many different places in Vegas but Bellagio is at the top of my list. The hotel is great, the staff is great and helpful, the food is amazing and we always have a great time! I can’t wait to go back"
1838,2.0,Lots of money for rooms with lots of problems,"Couple hundred dollars a night for a room with a broken air conditioner that wasn’t fixed until 1am, house keeping left dirty rags on the counter before check in and over half the lights had been unscrewed. Definitely not a “resort” and definitely not worth of the price they want for the rooms. Didn’t gain a repeat visit here that’s for sure."
1839,5.0,5 star,Free tram to other mgm properties lot of restaurant option on site and near by. Plenty of pools and pool seating available both in sun and shaded areas.The casino floor has lots and table games and slots to choose from.
1840,5.0,Another great stay at my favorite property,"My third stay at Bellagio, and every time it exceeds my high expectations. The hotel itself has every type of room for all budgets. I stayed in the Bellagio Suite, an excellent upper mid range room. After much research I find it to be the best bang for the buck on the strip. If you book direct with a rewards card, you can save up to 30% off. I also used VIP services, and the entire staff there is excellent, but special shout out to Bonnie and Anna. It costs a bit ($150/day), but they handle everything, reservations, transportation, pool services (also a special shout out to Christine at the Cypress pool for her attentive service), private elevators, they make it all special. I could go on and on, but the only bad experience was Casino hosts, that were rude, and I had a $25K"
1841,5.0,Another Bellagio stay,"The Bellagio is the only resort I stay in when I take my trips to Las Vegas. I believe if you are going to do Vegas, you have to do it right. From the European charm of the resort, to some of the best staff in town, I never go wrong when staying at the Bellagio!"
1842,5.0,Loved it,"Such a beautiful experience, my room was amazing with an awesome view!!! The hotel staff are All so friendly and professional! And the location was perfect, right in middle of everything! Made it convenient to see everything!"
1843,1.0,Theres always an employee ruins the whole experience,My friend and I went to Vegas in March of 2022 and we stopped by Bellagio to see the conservatory and fountains and the casinos and everything else great you can see at Bellagio. We first headed to the mlife counter since I needed to get a new mlife gold card but the rep there so rude and very discriminating towards my friend and I. We are asian since the guy customer in front of us who was causation she was laughing and seemed friendly too. She didnt bother make eye contact and acted as if we were a bother and was very rude. Last time we stayed at the hotel two yrs before they gave us a smoking room when we reserved for a non smoking one. We tried to stay there but after one night it was unbearable and when we asked to change rooms the front desk rep said “you guys only have
1844,1.0,Motel 8 at Bellagio,"Pretty facility, but very costly without the quality. It felt like airline service. Eating options limited. Broken bathroom tiles, clogged drain, charged for minibar items we never took, food carts left in hallways for a day. Strong sewer odor for 2 days by the poker room."
1845,5.0,Beautiful Hotel - Comfortable Accommodations,"The hotel is beautiful! We stayed in a ""Stay Well"" room. It gets 5-stars on comfort, furnishings and cleanliness. I have asthma, so this was especially important to me. The staff is friendly and very willing to help."
1846,5.0,Just Awesome!!!,Great time. We really enjoyed ourselves. Lots to do and really has a resort feel to it. We had brunch at Spago and dinner at Yellowtail. Great food and Service. Both restaurants sat us in the patio by the fountain. Awesome experience.
1847,5.0,Pure Luxury,"From check in to check out this resort was a wonderful experience. Great service, wonderful room and as always the buffett was amazing!!! The flowers were so pretty as well, fresh flowers throughout the entire resort really give it that luxurious feeling."
1848,5.0,Birthday party,"Our friend turned 55, a group of us flew to Vegas to celebrate with him. We stayed at the Bellagio for the first time, loved the room and casino overall. Definitely will be back. One small complaint, I wish there were more quick places to eat."
1849,5.0,Best Hotel on the Strip,"Beautiful, clean rooms, fast and efficient staffs. Apart from the cigar smoke when I pass by the casino lounge and lacking security personnel on d entrances and exits around the hotel, I will still recommend it to others visiting LV."
1850,5.0,Bellagio has it all!,"We didn't even leave the building. Bellagio had it all! Beautiful room, great entertainment, excellent restaurants, new and older slot machines. Prime Steakhouse is a must & for breakfast or lunch Sadelle's Cafe is highly recommended."
1851,2.0,No Coffee,There is no coffee shop open before 8 am! The gym does not open before 8 am! There are no coffee pots in room. I was told to order room service. Too many other hotels in Vegas. I’ll go to the Wynn next time.
1852,4.0,Conference at Bellagio,"Had a Tech conference at the Bellagio, the convention area was great, the location was great and the amenities were great. The food was upscale for the lunch and cocktail functions and the staff was polite and courteous ! I would recommend!"
1853,5.0,Beautiful resort.,"What an amazingly beautiful resort. Even with a room facing away from the strip, the view of the mountain was stunning. The staff goes above and beyond. Definitely eat at Yellowtail! The salmon melts in your mouth. We didn’t get to swim because the weather was unusually chilly, but they looked beautiful."
1854,1.0,Horrible service,"Upon checking in I requested a smoking room, and when I finally arrived to my room wich was across the other side of the resort, I'm seeing that it's non smomking wich wasn't at all what I requested n when I called n said I got the wrong room they said not a problem come back n just tell them ur getting ur room keys exchanged so you don't wait in line, n when I arrived I asked one of the workers about where to go to recieve my new key he then walked me over to the back of the line and had me wait to get my keys exchanged to wich I waited another 30 minutes!!! I finally got to my room and got my things situated n decided to go explore and when I got to the valet to receive my vehicle we then had another issue with one of the valet workers. I had asked him how to pay for my 24"
1855,5.0,Wonderful Stay ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,"Bellagio is Thee place to stay on the Strip. Entire staff is Warm & Gracious. Room Service was Amazing; such an Amazing detail to our specific order. If you're planning a trip to Vegas, Bellagio is THEE only place to go!"
1856,4.0,Bellagio,"Very nice hotel, excellent location. Room was very clean & housekeeping tended to clogged shower right away. $45 “resort fee” added to bill each day, apparently I had not read the fine print, but overall, worth the price. The bed & pillows were super comfy! Nice pools/lounge areas."
1857,1.0,Poor Housekeeping,Beautiful hotel with excellent location. But extremely poor housekeeping service. They are too busy to get you any personal attention. Everything is extremely overpriced. The flower arrangement is marvelous.
1858,2.0,Unsanitary,My family went on a trip to vegas and stayed at the bellagio. When we reached our rooms my brothers room had blood and other things in it while my room had dirty sheets. Will not be staying here again.
1859,5.0,Fountains in Vegas,Beautiful hotel. Love the pool. Room service. Sports Book. Center of it all. Can’t wait to come back. Need a fountains view next time to make it a little more special for us. See you in the fall. Xoxo
1860,4.0,Bellagio truly is a beautiful landscape,Beautiful hotel with a beautiful view! The view of the fountain from the room is more amazing than viewing from the street view! Wonderful staff. Kids loved watching the fountain from above and the tv has a channel that plays the song that goes along with the fountain show! Simply amazing!
1861,4.0,Back to Vegas at the Bellagio,Bellagio is nice but expensive! Roulette table limit of $25 with $5 chips really limits your play time - they should let you play with $1 chips. Buffet is good if you are extremely hungry otherwise pass for the cost. Enjoyed the Cyprus pool
1862,5.0,Very good,"A birthday vacation, did not receive any gift😂😂 Nice time too far to walk to get to a destination Will have to bring a scooter next time, may not be anytime soon. Casino were not great, payoffs were not so good."
1863,5.0,Amazing,What a brat place to stay. We had a great time and loved staying there. The food was great the casino was great and the Bellagio is absolutely beautiful. We would definitely go back. Make sure you have your walking shoes on because the Bellagio is very big and there is so much to see. Enjoy!
1864,5.0,Brian,"Staff did an excellent job accommodating us on very short notice, Lounge staff at Prive' were awesome , an all around great trip, look forward to the next trip to the Bellagio & a great meal at Prime !!"
1865,1.0,Bellagio Stay,"Not sure wat is going on at the Bellagio; this hotel/property is trading on its REPUTATION and DELIVERING far less. It’s like “LIPSTICK” ON A PIG.” Hype with no service. As a customer it is my belief that they opened up, are trading on their former REPUTATION and do not have staff to support the operation. Plenty of SUITS running around with weak excuses and won’t look customers in the eye. Sorry’s don’t fix problems!"
1866,5.0,Love the Bellagio!!!,"The Bellagio is my favorite hotel to stay in Vegas! It's beautiful, smells wonderful, clean, and rooms are perfect with the most comfortable beds and pillows. Plus, the staff are super friendly and helpful. Plus, it's location is in the middle of the strip."
1867,5.0,Fun,"My wife enjoyed our first Vegas experience together. Good times, food, drinks. Hard to win at the tables but overall we had a very nice time. We also enjoyed the view overlooking the waterfall at the front of the Belligio."
1868,5.0,"Great hotel, great service.","The check-in was superb, a very easy process. Hotel staff was cordial and very helpful. Buffett price was a bit unexpected but with so many food options, I had enough choices to feel well treated in that area too."
1869,4.0,Excellent Staff,"Every single staff member was extremely helpful and professional. No matter what issue I had, I was about to find a solution with their help. Every inch of the property what upscale, it almost felt unreal. The only issue I had was the picture of my room said I would have a jacuzzi tub. I did not! Still great experience with the walk in shower."
1870,5.0,My stay was exceptional. The service and staff were great. My suite was top of the line.,"Large suites, staff and service during my stay was great. I will definitely being staying again in my upcoming visit this summer. Many amenities available through the hotel also. Great food in the restaurants throughout the hotel."
1871,5.0,Always a great stay,Wonderful time at your hotel. The room was clean. The staff always helpful. The bartenders always smiling and friendly and helpful. Son at the baccarat bar for 30 years has always been nice and helpful and always a good time. Everything was fine with us as always. Coming back in August.
1872,5.0,Exotic Trip !,"It was an Amazing experience! Everyone was super nice! Food was Great! Slots were very fair! It was a Father & Son trip and did not disappoint !! The resort is beautiful, all of the employees are welcoming and helpful. All of the services were Amazing! The cleanliness and Sanitation was 2nd to none. I didn’t win this trip but the Slots and Tables were extremely fair ."
1873,5.0,Beautiful fun and enjoyable stay at Belagio,"It was beautiful the parking was close to the building the lobby , I got free parking free play for 40$ it was great and the rooms were free , I won a 700$ on the machine gambling it was great very thankful , the room was very comfortable felt very safe too"
1874,5.0,Very pleased,This was my first stay at the Bellagio. I did a pre check in on the app and the experience was great. My room was amazing. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Can't wait to go back and book at the Bellagio again!
1875,4.0,Four nights at Bellagio,"Bellagio is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Everything is first rate with the exception of the casino where a dealer took 25 dollars of mine. I asked for change, and she kept it and said thank you! WTF! I would definitely stay there again, but the blackjack dealer left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
1876,5.0,Belliggo King Fountain View Suite,"Recently had offer to stay at Belliggo with a suite on 26th floor, incredible view of fountain and strip. First time to stay in Belliggo and couldn't be happier with the stay. Food and drinks were awesome and the casino play was great. Can't wait to go back."
1877,5.0,Bellagio is a must see in vegas,"Beautiful and relaxing! Great accommodations , food and cocktails. Friendly staff all around and the fountains are a sight to behold.. Our host took the best care of us and we will be back soon!!!!"
1878,5.0,Views,"This hotel was amazing. The rooms where so clean and beautiful. Loved the fountain views. I can’t wait to go back. Next time I want to relax by the pool. The hotel shopping was so convenient, great stores."
1879,5.0,Girls vacation weekend.,I loved it. all the staff was wonderful. the check-in process on the app was great and super easy.. The pool staff was helpful finding chairs for our group and very friendly. The room was clean and towels delivered daily.
1880,5.0,Celebrating a 50 year friendship with BFF!,Excellent facilities and staff. 5 star accommodations. Casino best in Vegas. No need to ever leave the Hotel. Upscale dining and shopping. Spa and pool an absolute dream. Relaxation was the theme and the Bellagio did not disappoint! Thank you all! A+++

1883,5.0,First time visit and I will stay again.,"Friendly and professional staff, clean and cozy rooms, great restaurants, great location with the best view to the fountain show, awesome experience overall. First time visit and definitely I will stay again. I completely recommend."
1884,5.0,Fantastic!,"Tremendous place The very best of everything Service, food and setting to die for The very standard of excellence in Las Vegas From check in to the pool Staff and spa treatment the Bellagio is heavenly"
1885,5.0,Luxury,Best of the best A luxury accommodation friendliness professionalism. A great atmosphere to relax and forget the rest of the world. I am sad Best dining Options you can find anywhere. Gaming It's great
1886,5.0,Best hotel.,Best experience ever. Friendly workers. I used the mobile app so my check in and check out were very easy. Room was very nice and clean everything I wanted was easy acces. I would definitely recommend friends and family to stay here.
1887,4.0,Ballagio Family Trip,"Typically we stay at Aria, but decided to give Bellagio a try this year. I wish we would have stay at Aria as usual. The only thing nice about the room was the fountain view, everything else was average. The room size is small (at least it felt smaller than Aria) and we didn’t get house keeping at all. I’m not sure if we had to call for house keeping, but even when I asked it didn’t happen. I’m definitely staying at Aria again next year."
1888,4.0,Very good but not excellent.,This is just like any other big resort. It was crowded and noisy. The traffic was directed to pass through to the casino. I guess that is where the money is. The restaurants within the resort we’re only average. The prices for food were equal of most of the restaurants in the city but the quality was not there. It’s hard to imagine how someone could mess up bacon eggs. There is lots of glitz but glitz doesn’t make one comfortable in the room. We only ordered room service once and it took an hour and a half to arrive. The bed was comfortable though.
1889,5.0,Las Vegas trip,Bellagio is a great hotel. Top notch. Rooms were great. We had the fountain view definitely worth the extra money. The Bellagio pool is great. The show O might be the best show I’ve ever seen. Check in and check out were easy.
1890,5.0,Mini vacation,"My time at the Bellagio was fantastic, from the day I arrived to my departure everything was outstanding from the restaurant to the show O, Lifetime of memories I will share with everyone I know Thank"
1891,1.0,Poor amenities,Fitness club was not open during posted hours. 50 guests were lined up to enter. I left after a 30 minute wait. Room service had me on hold for 20+ minutes. Room was nice. Conference rooms were noisy from adjacent rooms.
1892,3.0,Not as good as usual,"Mobile check-in was unreliable so plan to see someone at front desk. Maintenance never came to clean the room, but did bother to come knocking on the door at 1pm the day of departure despite the fact I prepaid for a 3pm late checkout. Very annoying."
1893,2.0,Disappointed,"Reception not very knowledgeable in rate promos. Room was dusty. Housekeeping was not provided one day. Took a while to get some clean towels and shampoo up to my room. Employees not very friendly either, especially at the Café Gelato. Overall, not what you would expect from a Five Star hotel!!!"
1894,5.0,Great place Stunning decor Layout is great Lots of pools restaurant selection could be better,Great place Stunning decor Layout is great Lots of pools restaurant selection could be better .....Gambling is great Catering and function halls are Top notch Would schedule my next event there . Loved the Water fountain show
1895,5.0,All around great experience!,Rooms and bathrooms are large! The beds are amazingly comfortable! The food and coffee at SNACKS are delicious! Check in with the app and avoid the lines at check in starts a vacation out hassle free!
1896,3.0,Some things lack,"It was not the first time staying here at all, entrance is beautiful, though as usual for Vegas, kitsch is everywhere. If I went gambling, I would do so in here, as the casino here looks better than elsewhere. The hotel is huge, there are many places to have a walk in here, many luxurious shops. Other than that, check in is very slow, we payed extra for a room that is supposedly their more relaxing rooms (I don't remember the title for them), I am a light sleeper and it is pretty important not to feel loud noises in hotel rooms, they assured there will be no noises, but there were, you can here things from the street anyway. Our room was renewed, but some other guests didn't find slippers or a robe."
1897,2.0,Room renovations not thought out for guest comfort or needs.,"Lack of closets. Lack of room for luggage so it’s not left on floors. Lack of comfortable mattress. Lack of desk. Lack of extra towels. Lack of bathroom supplies such as shampoos, ect. Was given one. Lack of two chairs to sit at table and even eat or have coffee. Regular rooms removed tubs and don’t even have shower doors! No room for grooming on counter tops in regular room bathrooms. Poor shower heads. Leaking showers. So disappointing. The over all renovation was done cheaply. Saving old floors, door hardware and removing furniture. Overall a great disappointment."
1898,2.0,Not the same Bellagio,"Have stayed here many times thru the years, always had a good experience, this time not so much. AC in room never fully cooled down, DONT TOUCH the mini bar, I did eat a snickers bar and expected to pay for it, in my check out bill there were charges for $70, $8, and $5, not sure which one was the Snickers bar. In discussing it with the front desk, it takes 2-3 days to ""audit the mini bar fridge"" have not heard the outcome of this in depth investigation will be."
1899,5.0,Great hospitality,"Great hospitality, our room was very comfortable. Very clean 10/10 I can’t wait to come back with my whole family we had such a great time with you guys I appreciate it all of you thank you so much. ❤️"
1900,5.0,The Great Bellagio,I believe the was one of our best trips as a couple. I was able to ask my girlfriend to marry me and we got to celebrate my younger sisters birthday. An open mini fridge and a microwave would be nice for leftovers from your wonderful selection of restaurants. A little more freeplay points would be nice too but the gabling was nice. Get some $5 and $10 craps tables would be nice too. We will be back soon. Thanks
1901,3.0,Disappointed,"For the price and promise, the Bellagio was disappointing. The cleanliness and maintenance was totally lacking in our room, in the elevators, in the cafe areas. Our room bathroom floor was dirty and stained. A lamp was broken and shade damaged. The dresser had stains and marks along the front. The exterior of the windows (fountain view) were extremely dirty. Inside the elevators were runs down the walls and built up dirt. Overall very poorly maintained. I would expect what we experienced from a 2 or 3 star older hotel. There was an upside, and that was the staff. All were very lovely, pleasant, helpful, and well versed in the positions."
1902,3.0,Better properties,Staff was great and the shops are nice. Walking through the casino and lobby it wreaks of smoke. And you will smell like it the rest of the day. My non smoking room smelled of smoke and the a/c barely worked. I was promised a view of the fountains on booking and all I could see was a concrete wall. I was promised an upgrade the next night and didn’t receive it. there are definitely better properties out there with all the new ones. I also wait an hour and fifteen for a cold 60 dollar cheeseburger and fries at room
1903,1.0,Not worth the money!!,"The staff was very rude starting with the servers at the pool area, they were not helpful nor did they wanna take my order. The room was dirty there was trash left over in the bathroom. Check in with smooth since I didn’t have to have any conversations with the staff I did everything through my phone."
1904,5.0,Business Trip,"Overall very good, was charged for something on the refreshments, but nothing was taken. it wasn't worth arguing over. Very beautiful resort. The dental convention we attended was well worth the trip...Thank you."
1905,5.0,Business event,Had a very good time with our stay at the Bellagio. The casino and hotel was very clean. Staff that we interacted with were very nice and helpful. We would stay again. We look forward to future stays at the MGM Resort Hotels.
1906,1.0,Bad time,Check in was terrible. No explanation of charges and I was charged incorrectly. Just a sorry when I spoke to someone no compensation. The Bellagio is the center of the strip and a great location. To be met with rude service and no one taking accountability is so disappointing
1907,3.0,Underwhelmed,Sticky red drips on bathroom floor. Dark substance splattered on bathroom ceiling. Toilet splashed onto the ground every time it was flushed. Showerhead was caked with mineral deposits and water pressure was very lacking. Footstool in front of bed had the shape of a clothing iron burnt into its fabric. Hangers marked for robes in the closet were empty. Room was overall very basic and not worth the price that Bellagio asks.
1908,5.0,Excellent Rooms and Customer Service,"You cannot beat this location on the strip. Center of it all, beautiful views, comfortable beds, etc. Wonderful staff all around, so accommodating and also very secure. Easy to get around even with 2 rooms in different sections of the hotel."
1909,4.0,Great stay at the Bellagio!,"My stay at the Bellagio was amazing, great staff, clean and spacious room, artwork and hotel was so nice to stroll through. I would recommend this venue to anyone planning a business convention or just a fun stay."
1910,5.0,Trip to Vegas,"While visiting family in Phoenix, we headed to for a quick night in Fabulous Las Vegas. We had a wonderful night's stay after catching ""O"" by Cirque du Soleil. The entire evening was spectacular. The fountain show was great. The Bellagio is worth every penny."
1911,5.0,BEAUTIFUL right in the heart of the strip,We loved our stay here! This hotel is right in the heart of the strip close to so many things! The beds in our room were AMAZINGLY comfortable! The staff was so friendly and the pools are great as well.
1912,5.0,Best stay in Vegas,I have been to Vegas on several occasions and this by far was the best hotel I have ever experienced. The friendless and helpfulness of the staff made this a great experience for my girls trip. We had a blast!
1913,4.0,It’s the best hotel on the strip,"There's no denying the prestige of Bellagio Hotel. It is a grand and stunning beaut that sits on a prime location on the Vegas strip. A trip to Sin City is not complete without stopping by here. Be it to visit to the conservatory with its ever changing arrangements each season or to watch the jaw-dropping fountain show, one does not need to stay here to experience the luxurious amenities it features. They also house celebrity chef restaurants such as Chef Michael Mina's Mina specializing in seafood as well as Chef Julian Serrano's Picasso that has stunning views of the fountain, both with Michelin stars to boot. Looking for some entertainment? Cirque du Soleil's jaw-dropping O is not to be missed and they've been a resident show here for over a decade. If you're feeling"
1914,5.0,My Vegas home,"We have been going to Bellagio since it opened. The total experience is what we like. The location on the strip is ideal. ...""O"" is my favorite Cirque show. and I think I've seen them all. This was probably my 10th the at ""O""...and I will be back.Room service was good."
1915,5.0,Only Bellagio,Simply excellent as always. Table limits have gotten a little too high. But extreme value in every other service provided by this property. Room was superb. Staff were all extremely friendly. Won’t stay anywhere else.
1916,3.0,Ok but could improve,"No direction given to correct guest tower. Food overpriced. Casino dealers not friendly. Push mgm app people in sportsbook. No water provided in rooms in the desert! Should provide comp water for invited guests and at least 2 bottles in room per day, since, you know, it is the desert!!!!"
1917,5.0,Always A Great Experience,"Dinner at Jasmine, poolside lounges with amazing and friendly staff, Breakfasts at Sidelles always a treat. We always look forward to the outstanding floral displays especially in The Conservatory. A special shout out to Oksana in VIP Services who handled all questions clearly and with patience and a smile. She is the epitome of excellent customer service. Can’t wait for our next visit."
1918,4.0,"Great, but some changes!","First I will say that we have visited Las Vegas many times in the last 10 years and have ALWAYS stayed at the Bellagio. It is one of, if not, the best resort on the strip. Rooms are large and comfortable, pool area is beautiful, conservatory and fountains are amazing to smell and see. Having said that, I must say that things have changed a bit since our last visit. One, room cleaning is now on a request only basis which is fine, but no one told us this during check in. Two, hours have changed at Sadelle""s (old Cafe) so now you can't have a nice quiet snack in the wee hours of the morning. Three, hours have changed at the Buffet, (which is awesome), dinner at the Buffet is gone. Fourth, we had a double sink in our room but when shaving in one, the other backed up and"
1919,5.0,Golf Tournament,"Pro AM golf tournament was the reason for the trip. Be sure to have breakfast at Sadelle's - delicious food, wonderful service, and wonderful coffee. The Conservatory is beautifully decorated in pastels for Easter. Be sure to eat at Prime Steakhouse - great food and ambiance."
1920,4.0,Everything amazing but sleep quality due to room not cooling down.,"Nice but air-conditioning not great in the room. Room was beautiful, beds were comfy, but room would not cool down. I called for assistance but did not call back for a long time. We slept in a room that was stuffy and hot."
1921,5.0,Fabulous property,First time staying at this property Usually stay across the street at a suite hotel. Stay was lovely and hope to return back this summer. Used the pool facilities which was clean and inviting. Had drinks at the pool. Only wish had more servers coming around or existing severs come around more. Otherwise no complaints
1922,3.0,No I’m room coffee,"There was no coffee pot in room, so you have to walk 2 miles every morning for coffee. The shower head had no water pressure. The bath towels were stained and there was hair on the sheets of my “clean” bed."
1923,4.0,Bellagio,"Friendly staff, expected room to be more elegant.My rooms water pressure in the showers wasn’t great and you could hear the room next to us. Ate at harvest and the food was delicious. There was plenty of seating at the pool and service was great."
1924,5.0,Vegas,"The overall experience was fantastic, the staff was super friendly and the food was amazing, however the last night we wanted to stay low and grab a drink in the hotel and we didnt have our own hotel bar.. that was the only downfall!"
1925,5.0,Vegas,"The overall experience was fantastic, the staff was super friendly and the food was amazing, however the last night we wanted to stay low and grab a drink in the hotel and we didnt have our own hotel bar.. that was the only downfall!"
1926,5.0,amazing,"everything was exceptional, from staff to housekeeping, although the noise level could improve. The staff at the front desk were very helpful especially when I requested a room transfer, they accommodated my request quick"
1927,5.0,ThriveLIVE2022,The hotel staff was very helpful through the entire convention directing us the entire day. I felt safe within the hotel. They had excellent elevator security to protect us from anyone that did not belong in the hotel.
1928,4.0,Anniversary and Birthday Trip,"The Bellagio is the Standard, that being said we may have had our expectation set too high. The public areas; Check-in, Casino and Conservation areas were amazingly clean. We loved spending time looking at the flowers and the fountain shows. The hallway to our room was not so clean, the same dirty dishes from someones room service sat outside our room for 2 days before being picked up. This was a special occasion for us so we splurged on the Bellagio, it was nice don't get me wrong, just not sure it is worth paying triple the price of staying across the street at Planet Hollywood. Love the views from our Fountain View Room though."
1929,3.0,Mediocre,Mediocre at best. Paid extra for a fountain view room but the windows were SO filthy that you could barely see out of them. The bathroom faucet was on its last leg and falling apart. Dust everywhere. Not enough chairs at the pool. The food options not great. We went to the Wynn for every meal. Our first and last stay at the Bellagio
1930,5.0,Las Vegas getaway,"The hotel experience was great. Stayed in one of the Penthouse suites on the 29th floor and the fountain view was amazing. Housekeeping staff were also attentive with our needs. The front office supervisor was accommodating and helpful, too. You won’t run out of things to do here."
1931,3.0,General review,"In general Bellagio is beautiful and nice and fairly kid friendly if that’s what you are looking for. It’s very busy which gets old fast. Long lines and tons of people everywhere, crowding every direction you turn, and people constantly stopping to take pics etc so add an extra 20 min anywhere you go for people traffic. Another HUGE issue IMO is that there is no where to eat after 11pm in the hotel or casino except room service… so room service gets so backed up the wait times are ridiculous… I mean, I can go to an MGM Casino in Washington DC and get a meal after midnight for Gods sakes, so what’s going on in Vegas?! When you come off the tables at midnight and wanna grab a bite before bed only to find out that room service is your only option and it’s an hour and a half wait"
1932,5.0,Best Hotel to stay,"Great staff, beautiful lobby, nice room. I would recommend the Bellagio Hotel the location is perfect and for me still is the best option to stay in the strip. Beautiful pool to relax. Ice cream and croissants in Cafe Gelato I love it!!!.."
1933,3.0,1st Bellagio Experience,"We stayed Apr 8 with family and friends. First, the bed is disappointing since it was not properly prepared (linen crumpled, not folded on the side. Then, when we report the guy who answered was rude."
1934,5.0,Beautiful property and great stay.,Beautiful property. The fountains and conservatory are both amazing. The room was also beautiful and the bed was so comfortable. Pool was perfect. Lots of chairs available. The casino was fun and Lago Restaurant was beautiful and delicious.
1935,2.0,Did not meet expectations,"Luxury prices but low budget services. The dining and entertainment options are too limited, formal and outdated. Maintenance and cleanliness is clearly not a priority as the bathroom in the lobby was filthy and room service trash was left in the hallways multiple days. Be prepared to pay a daily premium if you want a lounge chair close to the pool."
1936,2.0,Did not meet expectations,"Luxury prices but low budget services. The dining and entertainment options are too limited, formal and outdated. Maintenance and cleanliness is clearly not a priority as the bathroom in the lobby was filthy and room service trash was left in the hallways multiple days. Be prepared to pay a daily premium if you want a lounge chair close to the pool."
1937,5.0,Exceptional hotel and staff.,Omela at the front desk welcomed us and provided excellent service. Zack at the vallet service also made us feel at home. The ambiance of this hotel and the fountain view from our room was amazing. Highly recommend this hotel.
1938,5.0,Will be back guaranteed,"Birthday trip for me and my wife her brother and his wife came along also. Hotel, self parking, casino, hosts, servers, waitresses were all a 10 to me. Cashier and mgm rewards were good to me! Plus it was my bday!"
1939,4.0,Service Issues,"First time at Bellagio. Stay at Venitian or Wynn on our visits, however, had a meeting at Bellagio, so thought we’d give it a try. There 3 days. On last day checked out at 2:40, because of late flight, left bags at bell station, and went to pool. Ordered food and drinks via digital ordering from seat at the pool. Drinks came in less than 5 minutes. After 1.5 hours, no food. Inquired for a supervisor/ manager at the 1 hour point. No one showed. Had to leave for flight. Appeared that staffing was an issue, which was a bad look based on number of pool staff, just standing around."
1940,5.0,Could Not Have Been Better,"The Hotel was unbelievable the staff was Friendly and informative, and the atmosphere was fun. This was mine and my Wifes first trip to Las Vegas and could not have been more pleased. We are looking forward to going back"
1941,5.0,Worth the money,"Great location, great rooms, great casino. Check in with the app is so nice because you don’t have to wait in line at the desk. Signing up for the MGM rewards is so worth it. We got the room free, free play, and free food credits from the last trip there."
1942,5.0,"Wow, just wow!","We stayed at the Bellagio because that is where the convention I was attending was being held. After the “business” part of our trip was over, is was very easy for the fun to start with the spa, pool, casino and shops all just a few steps away. Best work trip ever!"
1943,2.0,NOT 5-star.,"If you’re at all used to five star hotels, this is not one of them. Skip it. It felt like a carnival cruise with better dining options. Rooms are dated, service is slow, abysmally incompetent, public spaces are a congested mall in New Jersey. If this is typical Vegas I think I’d rather stay home. Only came for the Grammys and hope they don’t come back here. If anyone has stayed at the four seasons in Vegas I’d love to know if it is as expected. I don’t think any of these casino resorts are anything but as I’ve described above."
1944,5.0,Trip of a lifetime,"We’ve wanted to stay at the Bellagio, with the fancy fountain view, for 15yrs! It did not disappoint. Watching the fountains was one of the most fun events the whole weekend. The room and service were the nicest we’ve had on the Strip."
1945,4.0,Dog issue,Room and facilities are ideal. Unfortunately right across the hall from me a dog started whining at 3am. I suspect the owner was gone otherwise they would have attended to the dog. It’s not the dogs fault but the non attentive owner. I paid a lot of money for a nice fountain view would have been better off somewhere else. They should have specific floors for pets.
1946,1.0,"No hot water in the shower, poor attempt to remedy","We had hot water issues all weekend for a $500 a night suite. A room without hot water should have been at least one night comp, if not both. They took $300 off our food bill and comped the resort fee. We should’ve gotten more back for not being able to SHOWER. We’ll stay anywhere but next time."
1947,5.0,the best in Vegas 1,"this is the most beautiful casino in Vegas , especial the water shows on the water fountain , never gets tire watch it ,always took lots of pictures and video of it , this places is beautiful inside and out and the services always the best the staff are so friendly ."
1948,5.0,Always a nice stay,"This trip was a quick one, but Bellagio does not disappoint. Check in was a breeze despite the line, room service was delivered on time and was delicious! Staff perusual, was beyond helpful. I would definitely stay again."
1949,5.0,Lisa W at The News Stand - wonderful!,"I did not stay at this hotel, but I had dinner here. On the way to dinner, my colleague and I stopped at The News Stand. We were assisted by Lisa W. She was so helpful and kind to us. We went in before dinner and after dinner for various items. She was incredibly personable. Both of us appreciated her engagement with our needs."
1950,1.0,Premium suite room is warm,"We got the premium suit facing the fountain, we paid additional 100 usd on too of the rate, for the reason it is already available as what the front desk told us but it took them an hour before they called and telling me that its already available. The room cost 700 plus usd. The interior of the room is old,"
1951,5.0,Bellagio Hotel,The hotel is perfect in every way. Rooms are immaculate every detail is done in good taste. Plenty of food options. Pool and the view is amazing. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
1952,5.0,Bellagio is Amazing!,"We really enjoyed our stay in Bellagio. We stayed at the Staywell room 24044 Two Queen Beds with Fountain View. The fountain show is amazing. Watching from the room is relaxing. Turn in Channel 22 on TV for the fountain show music. After check in we bought a lot of water from CVS across from Bellagio. There are no Keurig inside the room. We ordered daily coffee from room service, it’s about $9.50 delivery fee, plus the cost of the coffee which is $12. You get over 32 oz coffee along with cream and sugar. It’s better than going downstairs and standing in long lines by Starbucks. You can watch the strip and sunrise while drinking your coffee. We ate brunch at Sadelle’s. Their Fish Tower was really good. We went twice at Bellagio Buffet. Food was really good. We didn’t have our"
1953,5.0,Business Workcation,"I stayed with my work team for a week at the Bellagio. We enjoyed our stay. We had dinner at the Prime Steakhouse, enjoyed the chicken and waffles from room service, got a chance to gamble and enjoy the fountain show. We even enjoyed an amazing day of working poolside. This hotel is right in the center of everything with the tram that we took to the Park MGM."
1954,3.0,Noisy room with street noise until past 3am,"Fountain view room was nice but incredibly loud, the fountain noise is expected but the street noise was impossible to block out. Had to sleep with noise canceling headphones playing something else, it finally stopped past 3am. No coffee in room, hand soap would be nice, overall for the price I didn’t think the guest experience was great"
1955,5.0,Birthday at the Bellagio,"Had a great time from shows to the pool. Food was excellent at Prime, especially at the Mayfair. At the Mayfair you can get a great dinner and show. You definitely want to get the MGM app to track your points and also get rewards for the money you spend at any MGM casino."
1956,5.0,Exceptional hotel,"This was my second time staying at the Bellagio. First time as a family trip. My husband and kids loved it!!!! There is so much for kids to do in Vegas and the Bellagio is the perfect hotel for a family friendly environment. It’s a quieter hotel, not so noisy and busy as the others. We enjoyed going to see shows at other busy hotels but come back to ours to relax for the night, the security is great, the pools are fabulous. Clean and always a spot to sit at. The food here at the Bellagio is amazing! Snacks is open 24 hours and had something for everyone. The patisserie has the best crepes and breakfast and we splurged and had brunch at Sadelle’s one morning. Make a reservation ahead of time. It can be pricey here but you get what you pay for. We will definitely be"
1957,5.0,Wonderful Stay,"Hotel is beautiful and the amenities are awesome. Beds was comfy and room very clean. Bathroom offer huge tub and shower. Also lovely pool, all in all we loved our stay and will return. Snack shop pizza was nasty and tough!"
1958,5.0,A Great Place to Celebrate a Milestone Anniversary!,"My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio in February for the first time. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary so we splurged and stayed in the fountain view penthouse for four nights. We loved it and will stay there again! (Sorry in advance for the length, but I think it’s much more useful and informative to say something other than, “It was great!” LOL) Check-in: We used the MGM mobile app to check in and that was wonderful! We did a pre-check in on the app and then when the room was ready, they texted us with the room number and the digital key was available in the app. We opted to go to the business center (next to the elevators) and print room keys rather than relying on the digital key. We got up to our room and called for the luggage (we had A LOT and didn't know how"
1959,4.0,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights and had a great time. The hotel was very busy, but check in was efficient - albeit I was told I had an upgraded room ""one of the best"" and I doubt that was true. I was also given an accessible room which I didn't need nor did I ask for. I felt a bit guilty in case someone else needed it but I was tired and need to go to sleep. The room was very large, with a view out over the pool. The beds were comfy and the bathroom huge and modern. I could not fault the amenities in the room either. The casino smelt of a lot of weed, which I guess is par for the course in Vegas now. The shops were roped off and slightly less accessible than previous visits. I had a great stay though and would come back as soon as I could."
1960,4.0,Beautiful Oasis of a Resort,"This is a spectacular resort that could be a ""wow'' anywhere in the world. It is so unlike most other Las Vegas hotels/resorts. Yes, there is gambling. Can't miss the tables and machines. But it is such a classy place with great attention to details. Rooms are terrific. Makes an average person feel like you have a tiny grasp of luxury. Two reasons the rating was a 4 and not a 5: Housekeeping failed to service our room three times in nine days, chalking it up to COVID era staff shortages. Also, lack of a nice but affordable restaurant. Have to leave the grounds to afford a meal. But it's always a beautiful walk!"
1961,3.0,Not Impressed,No daily room service .Poor room AC. Cigarette smoke overwhelming in casino. Unfortunately you have to walk through that same casino to get to and from your room. Fountain view doesn't mean you can see the fountain show.
1962,5.0,Tucker,Beautiful hotel. Highly recommend to anyone. Fun gambling machines. Wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Great bed. Awesome shower. Observatory area was spectacular with all the beautiful flowers. Loved floral arrangements at checking counters. Tulips everywhere were beautiful.
1963,3.0,Things are different,"We love the Bellagio, but the pandemic has caused it to lose some of its best qualities. Room service is only for orders over 100$. Restaurants were always crowded and unavailable. Hours to amenities were short and overcrowded when opened. The rooms and service are still wonderful."
1964,5.0,10 out of 10,"Clean rooms, friendly staff, simple check in/out, comfy beds and pillows, no noise in hotel rooms/hallways, beautiful pool area, bell desk was helpful and efficient, great location, and the fountains were gorgeous"
1965,1.0,Poor service,"Don’t be fooled by complimentary stay, it requires a hefty deposit upon arrival. The casino is small and not very inviting. The service is terrible with arrogant staff. House keeping only came once during a four night stay and when they did come they didn’t knock before entering the room. The pool is nice but older and has very limited hours. Very overrated property!!"
1966,5.0,Best trip ever,Me and my family enjoyed the hospitality and convenience. Lots to do in the hotel alone. My wife really loved the Birthday surprise. As a 23 year old my son loved everything about the hotel he felt like a baller in his words.
1967,3.0,Disappointed,During our four day stay we’ve had housekeeping once. Room service takes more than an hour. The a/c unit has gone out. Housekeeping has labeled our room as checked out when we were not. Front desk is not acknowledging our late check out request.Pool service was slow and the young lady simply forgot our order. Cable tv frequently disconnects.
1968,4.0,Check your bill before leaving the hotel,"Charged us 2 mini bar items, 2 consecutive nights. Front desk didn’t believe us we didn’t take anything and said they will check at 10am but never got a call. We had to call them multiple times and after 2 days charges were finally reversed. Also tried to charge us $70 for a room upgrade when we signed a form that the upgrade price was $30. If we didn’t check our bill before leaning we would have been charged $88 for 4 bags of nuts we didn’t eat and $80 for overcharging is the upgrade fee."
1969,5.0,No Other place I would like to stay at.,"Bellagio has been my home away from home. I love every visit. I love the food they offer and love their rewards program. It is centrallly located and if you love a walking vacation, this is the place to stay. You can walk north or south and enjoy. I would say Bellagio is kid friendly as well. There are tons of kid activity around Bellagio as well. a Must visit kind of place!"
1970,5.0,Amazing experience,"The Bellagio did not disappoint with the beautiful decor, gardens, shops, fountain show and friendly staff. Our room was spotless and had a perfect view of the fountain and strip. The casino is huge! Loved being in the middle of everything!"
1971,5.0,Bellagio Visit,Our fountain view room was stunning both inside and outside! Watching the Bellagio fountains from our room with the Eiffel Tower in the background was delightful! The room was so spacious and was elegantly decorated. The pools were delightful with attentive life guards. The poolside service has frequent check ins to make sure we had anything we may have needed. Our dinner at Spagos was enjoyable as we dined outside with spectacular views over the fountains. I would stay here again and recommend any of my friends to do the same!
1972,5.0,Bellagio Spring Break,Trip was overall amazing and the staff and location made sure that it stayed that way throughout the duration of the stay! I would suggest the Bellagio to anyone interested staying in Vegas. The location is in the center of anywhere you could want to go on the strip and the restaurant's located at the Bellagio were amazing.
1973,5.0,LOVED IT,The trip to vegas was nice overall. Room was beautiful and the stay was great! Enjoyed everything about this hotel. It’s a must to stay again at least once! The show was great at night. I fell in love with the nighttime view of Belagio.
1974,1.0,Watch your bill carefully,They will try to charge you a higher rate than what you booked. You have to be very careful and look at your bill. They did correct the matter but it wastes a great deal of time. One should not have such an experience. It is disgraceful.
1975,5.0,Lovely stay,Bellagio is one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. Every room is gorgeous and the staff is extremely friendly. We have stayed at majority of the mgm resorts and Bellagio exceeded our expectations at every turn.
1976,5.0,Kids’ spring break,"We stayed at a suite with 3 toilets in it. The whole suite was very clean. The floor was quiet. The bed sheets, comforters, bathrooms are exceptionally clean. We’re definitely going back there. The service was phenomenal as well!"
1977,3.0,not up to par,"To promote your hotel as a 5 star property is very misleading. The service there was more like the staff wanting you to thank them for letting you stay at the hotel and not the other way around. When you pay for service, you expect it. Too many pother hotels in the area that offer they same benefits for a lot less."
1978,5.0,The best remains better than the rest.,"The Bellagio has always been a tremendous experience. The staff and accommodations never fail to satisfy. As we emerge into the light of a post pandemic world, the Bellagio rightfully maintains it's reputation for high and uncompromising standards. Well done."
1979,5.0,Michael Franke business traveler,A great experience. Thank you. continue to send offer and I will stay with you. I do alot of gambling. Really enjoy the openess of your property and the tram that runs back and forth. The cab stand is always clear and is staffed by great people who really care.
1980,5.0,Best on Strip.,"We have stayed here many times, and have never been disappointed. Staff are always attentive and helpful too. We have experienced the rooms, shows, restaurants and casino. All are professionally staffed and a pleasure to visit."
1981,4.0,Check In Doesn't Happen at the Time They Say,"Check In states after 3:00 p.m., however when you arrive to check in that time, we were told it's ANYTIME AFTER 3:00 p.m., not guaranteed to check in at 3:00 pm. Our check in was 2 1/2 hours later. Spoke with Manager and stated she would give us a $250 food and bar credit for the issue, it never happened."
1982,5.0,Best location on the strip.,The Bellagio fountain room is worth the money! It is expensive but the quality was obvious. Loved the view and the beds were so comfy. Best sleep ever! Will definitely return. My teen had an amazing time and we loved the location. Best ever!
1983,5.0,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel. Best one on the strip in my opinion. Have been to many other hotels in Las Vegas and this one is the best when it comes to service, cleanliness, value, location, sleep quality and rooms. I highly recommend staying there whether it is for leisure or for business."
1984,5.0,Bellagio Las Vegas,"One on best hotels in Vegas, love our stay there, friendly staff. If you like shopping this is the place they have all designer’s stores. The location is excellent as this is at the center of Las Vegas strip. From Ubers, taxis or limousine you will find all here at any time."
1985,1.0,Horrible Stay,One of the worst customer experience trips I have ever had. Checked in and requested a room that was closest to the Aria. Was assigned a room as far away as I could have gotten. Wait staff for breakfast was extremely inattentive. Ordered chicken sausage with breakfast 2 days in a rom and both times received bacon. Went to the fitness center at 6:30 am only to find out they did not open until 7:00. Literally 20 people waiting to get in at 7:00. Maybe they should take a clue from budget hotels that have 24 hour fitness room access. Upon checkout was told I would receive my receipt via email. No receipt received so I called the resort. Assured the email would go out immediately. No receipt. Maybe they have the wrong email address. Well no because I received their survey. Completely
1986,5.0,Almost Perfect,"Beautiful lobby, casino and restaurants. The staff was truly wonderful!! My one negative comment is the regarding the guest rooms. They are in need of updating, and a thorough cleaning. The curtains are dingy in need of cleaning or replacing. The bathroom was clean but not shining. It’s upkeep of the details that will maintain Bellagio’s stellar reputation."
1987,5.0,Best stay on your trip away,"If you want luxury, beauty, to be treated like family, and feel like royalty, the Bellagio is where you should go. Our trips here are always above and beyond. The staff is amazing and so warm and inviting. I recommend this hotel to those I know and those I don’t if I know they are headed to Vegas. It’s the most perfect place to stay."
1988,5.0,Always great,"Wife and I had a quick getaway and loved every moment of our stay. The spring display in the conservatory is arguably the best they’ve done. Jaw dropping. Table minimums are not the greatest, could be a little lower, but I do understand."
1989,5.0,Cleaning the room,They need to clean the room better! They left food in the room almost the whole time we stayed even asking them to grab it. We called and they still let it there. I wish they would of took it out of the room
1990,5.0,Great place to stay on the strip.,"Booked a few months in advance and got an incredible rate for a fountain view room. Clean room, great views, centrally located and worth the time to enroll in the MGM rewards program for the additional perks. Overall a great place to stay for business or pleasure."
1991,5.0,Perfect Location and Property,"We stayed for four days in an updated room that was perfect for the two of us, but could have accommodated more. On sight dining is varied and excellent. Especially enjoyed Sadelle’s for breakfast. We’ll stay here again on our next visit"
1992,3.0,The hotel rooms in need of a refresh.,"My room was never cleaned during my 4 night stay. Someone had smoked in my room and the shower drain was full of hair and wasn't draining. Inflation has in on full display here. You expect everything to be expensive at a hotel like this, but they take it to the next level. The room was cheap on online but it wasn't a nice room either. My event was at the Cosmopolitan next door. I should have paid the extra $100 per night to stay there. I gambled and ate at other resorts because the costs here are off the charts compared to the hotels on both side. The tables started way too high and Ceasars is right next door with much more options."
1993,3.0,Over the Hill property,"Used to be premium, and has now slumped into average category. Average stay/service for premium price point. To be clear, there were no issues, but we always aspired to stay at this hotel and we’re disappointed by the average service and stale environment."
1994,5.0,Amazing,Had a wonderful time at The Bellagio. Everything was amazing from the quality of the room and the view to the fountain show outside and everything in between. We’ll definitely be making a return trip and recommending it to everyone we know
1995,5.0,"Excellent stay, loved the facility","Had a great time; beautiful property with excellent service, food and gaming. Yellowtail was a fantastic meal, the Spa and gym are great facilities. Room service was good and very efficient, the gaming was great."
1996,5.0,Great experience,"Very clean, friendly, professional property and people. Food options were a nice variety. Will return to the hotel in the future. Provided a fantastic group rate on rooms for our guests. Always on top of our reservations."
1997,4.0,Good,"The room was great. The table games are too high the tables should be $5 from Morning until noon after noon $10 until 6PM then any amount you want The food is too expensive, $49 for the buffet is way too much. The food was great, but eating $49 is not possible"
1998,5.0,Our trip,"I love the Bellagio, specially the conservatory, I was a little disappointed in Sadelles, very pricey and the food was not that good . Everything else was quite nice. Would have been nice to have a tub in the room."
1999,5.0,Great 2 day trip,"Great, 2 day trip with friends to Vegas. The Bellagio was great. It was our first time staying there and our friends 4th and they wanted to go back. Everything was great, as you would expect from one of the best hotels on the strip. The shower drain was showing the buildings age as it drained very slowly and had you standing in water after 5 minutes, but that was our only issue. Would definitely go back."
2000,5.0,A beautiful three days,The hotel was fabulous! The Prime steak house was awesome the chef took excellent care of me and my daughter what a great time. Definitely want to come back. The spa was very relaxing . So much to do .
2001,5.0,The Best Hotel In Vegas,"Beautiful Hotel! Clean, luxurious rooms, great food and terrific service!! Love visiting the Conservatory to see the seasonal displays-it is simply amazing! Ask for lakeside view in either tower to see the water shows from your room-the music is on your tv. The ONLY place to stay in Vegas!!!"
2002,4.0,Good time in a lovely hote.,Food was great and the service was super. I always have an enjoyable stay at this topnotch property. The service level is consistent and staff makes sure that your needs are met. This is challenging given the volume of guest that visit the Bellagio.
2003,3.0,Thin walls,"Heard everything in hallways and next room. Need coffee makers! I like to have coffee while getting ready, don't want to get ready to get coffee. Food was great, pool staff was great, maid staff was great, Check in/out staff was very poor."
2004,5.0,"Amazing place to stay, play and enjoy!!!",Everything about this hotel was remarkable!!! Loved everything!!! The room service was wonderful while we watched basketball games and the service was great!!! I will stay there again in the future!!!! Amazing!!!!
2005,5.0,One night stay,"on a 9 night stay in Vegas, we treated ourselves to a night in the Bellagio, very quick check in, and was allocated a king room in the spa tower - the room was lovely and spotlessly clean, the bed was comfy and the Shower in the bathroom was great. Checkout was simple. We'll definitely be back to stay here again."
2006,5.0,Stunning,"Unbelievable stay, the service was what stood out the most, from every bartender and server we had to housekeeping. The property is actually laid out extremely conveniently compared to some of the other vegas properties. Amazing pool and gym complex."
2007,1.0,Worst check in experience ever in Vegas and it continues,"I have been to Vegas many times but never experienced like today. After long drive, we were greeted with confusion. We were asked out of blue if we wanted to upgrade for extra charge. We said no. Once we got into our room, it was not what I reserved. It was supposed to be King not two queens. Upon calling front desk and hassles, we were assigned to supposedly larger room but after waiting almost 50 min, security came with key for new room. Which was King but other than that, identical. So much for 100 sqft larger room promised for trouble. Then, in bath tup, something dirty came out which I took video so I can show to Front desk. So, we can’t even take bath after long day. I completely lost trust and it is extremely disappointing."
2008,5.0,3 day stay.,"Nice place. The only things I would add is the ability to have more fresh air into the room. But, Climate control in the room worked well. Staff extremely friend and was dedicated to hospitality and it shows."
2009,5.0,Anniversary,It Was A Great Experience I Had Great Service And I Enjoy My Stay At The Hotel Everything Was Clean And Got Great Housekeeping Services As Well The Front desk Was Amazing And Very Helpful they treated me great
2010,5.0,Bach/bachelorette party,"Great place with a ton to do, see, and eat. Drinks are plentiful. Lots of fun shows. Also great location to walk outside the hotel and people watch it shop. I highly recommend watching the fountain show outside the Bellagio."
2011,5.0,Great trip for pleasure and entertainment,Everyone working in every function were courteous and helpful during our stay. The cleanliness of the room and facilities made us want to stay in the hotel. Smoking was unpleasant at time in the casino.
2012,5.0,Great weekend getaway for my wife’s birthday,The room was nice with a view of the Fountain and the Vegas strip.Very friendly staff and great location. The pool was very nice and relaxing. The atrium was nice and well done. Food was a little pricey but overall great getaway.
2013,5.0,The entire stay was great,"What can say that requires 200 words. The stay was great. The casino was great, The view of the fountains was great. The room was great. The elevators were great. The food was great. The service was great. The promenade was great. ."
2014,5.0,The place to stay,Usual wonderful stay with a window seat for dinner. Love the wonderful flowers. Love the friendly staff. Great food and drinks. Fast check in with room just as it was supposed to be. Love the wonderful fountain shows.
2015,5.0,March Madness Weekend,"Stayed over the first weekend of the men's NCAA tournament. We pre-booked poolside chairs, cabana and spa. Which was all terrific. During check-in we requested the spa tower, and that side of the complex is so much quieter and nicer! The sportsbook app was super easy. And, date Michael Mina, Sago & Yellowtail - all fantastic."
2016,5.0,Exceeded expectations,Excellent stay at Bellagio. Room was clean and spacious. Staff was kind and efficient. Security assisted in recovering a lost item and was very professional. Food / Restaurant choices were great. O Theater was grand and all seating great. Hotel is beautiful from the inside flower garden to the outside fountains.
2017,5.0,Entertainment Capital of the World,A very clean and luxurious place to enjoy the glamor of Las Vegas. We come here every year to celebrate my daughter's birthday on March 22. The whole family enjoys eating at Jasmin and the Bellagio buffet. Of course the clean slot machines for fun.
2018,5.0,ALWAYS A GREAT TIME,SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH!! Rooms are big and very clean. Restaurants are some of the finest in the city at the Bellagio. Fountain is of course UNBELIEVABLE BEAUTIFUL. Can’t wait to go back again later in the year!!
2019,2.0,Disappointed,I was told there is no connecting room for my family with kids and they can do nothing about it even thought I requested one when I made reservation long time ago. Towels in room and swimming pool have black stain. Rooms are very noise even at late night. Staffs have no smile or greeting. Poor service! Only good is the location.
2020,5.0,Amazing,"Beautiful stay at a beautiful location. Every part of the strip feels luxurious, the Bellagio tops them in Everyway possible. Would recommend to any friends or coupes that are looking for a relaxing getaway."
2021,5.0,Beautiful,Love this hotel. Service was wonderful. Had a fountain view room . Everything was wonderful. Spent one day at the pool great service. The flowers are so beautiful . This hotel is one of my favorite places to go
2022,4.0,Fantastic room — but a few problems.,"Our room is large, quiet and comfortable with a great view of the fountains and the strip. It was one of their “suites” although it was not multi room, it was very large and in a good state of decor and up-keep. The suite was very expensive, but it’s size and quality probably justified the cost. Service and amenities presented some problems. These are the reason I could not give a five star rating. First, we had purchased a VIP package that included limo service from hotel to airport. But the limo did not pick us up, despite our many calls to the hotel. As it was getting late at night, eventually we took a cab. When we got to the hotel rather late, we had problems getting assistance in getting ourselves to our room, and difficulties in finding personnel to assist us. This"
2023,3.0,Pros and Cons,Pros The location of the hotel The large rooms and decor The security at the elevators Cons The mobile check in desk in the lobby was terrible. My husband and I said it made us feel like we were in a self check out lane at Wal-Mart. Not the kind of service we expect/demand at a place like the Bellagio! We were so frustrated we got in line to try to get real help. The young man who helped us there was great! There is nowhere to sit! It’s crazy. On occasion you need to wait for others in your party or you want to sit and eat your food or enjoy your drink. Please put back some sitting areas. The pool closes at 6! What? So disappointed in that. An employee admitted that it’s because they want everyone inside and gambling. That’s just wrong. What happened to doing what the
2024,5.0,Awesome Stay !,"One of the cleanest places on the strip ! Friendly staff, smells like flowers when you enter the building. Fast jackpot payouts ! Plenty of drink servers. Had a fountain view room. Amazing shows right out your window. And turn to channel 22 for the music ..."
2025,5.0,"Classy, good service","Clean rooms, nice hotel ambience. Quiet and relaxing to stay at. My kids loves the observatory. The fountain show is also awesome and enjoyable. Location at the strip is convenient. Would definitely consider coming back."
2026,5.0,Still the class of the strip,"Always wanted to stay at the Bellagio and it definitely was worth it. The location was convenient in the strip as you were never far from other venues. And it was great that you could go down any time to see the famous water fountain performance. One of my favorite sushi restaurants, Yellowtail, was also on the premises which made it very convenient."
2027,3.0,Nice place,"Our trip to Vegas was amazing with a small hiccup - the room was cleaned with no attention or care, very sloppy work, and the bathroom being very unhygienic to put it mildly had to ask them to send housekeeping to re-clean, but then had to leave the room for 2 hours. They should have offered another room, but the guest services didn’t seem to bothered that a guest had found a room in this condition."
2028,5.0,Top notch,Very good service. Staff was excellent and the best location. Would definitely stay here the next time out to Las Vegas. Wish it had a few more good options. The Buffet was ok but expensive. A small food court similar to Cosmopolitan would be a great plus.
2029,3.0,"Nice hotel, rooms average","Room was sub-par. Felt like a room at the holiday Inn. No water pressure in the shower, hot water was intermittent. Strip view room was the staff parking lot. Hotel itself was nice. Just not the room."
2030,5.0,Bellagio Spa Suite,I went to Las Vegas for a Scorpions Concert and stayed at the Bellagio. The service and room were exceptional. I would recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable and wonderful experience. I will be sure to stay at the Bellagio on my next Vegas visit.
2031,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,"We had a pool/garden view room on the 26th floor. The hotel is stunning from the fountains to the reception, the conservatory and our room. We had a non smoking room, with a great looking bathroom. We didn't touch where the fridge was located after reading reviews about being charged for items that are on a sensor so we didn't even look to make sure. We took a travel kettle and two mugs for tea ( we are British ! ) the room had an iron and ironing board. We took extra coat hangers and didn't use the bath robes hanging in the wardrobe space. Everywhere in Bellagio is spotless, so clean. We had muffins and pastries for breakfast but the hotel could do with more snack options as we always had to walk out for a snack rather than a meal especially at evening time. The position on the"
2032,5.0,The room had a site overseeing the fountains and strip very nice clean room.,"after losing 5,000 dollars knowing MGM gave me a room for free and no resort fees makes it feel a lot better then going home a loser , so making sure they gave me a room next time if they do the same it would make me feel its more of a gamble then paying for a room and resort fees"
2033,5.0,Hug Tina at Sardelle's!,"There is of course a reason. They're just relentlessly customer oriented. We did have a problem with clothes and a bag left in the room after we departed; but they responded well with a credit. The main reason for taking the time to review is actually to praise one of their many restaurants - Sadelle's. We're New Yorkers and very food-fussy. Although Sadelle's is not pushed like Puck or Harvest, it is consistently excellent from breakfast through lunch. Book early and often here. There is an authentically central-casting truly French boss there, who's brilliant. But the real jewel is Tina at the front desk. She looks and talks tough but is funnier than any comic on a Vegas stage. Make sure you stop and hug her on your way in....."
2034,5.0,Outstanding stay. Staff is awesome,Clean and well organized and the staff is outstanding. Rooms are well kept in the spa tower. My red eye flight got canceled and the front desk was extremely accommodating in finding me a room for an extra night on a Friday when they were almost booked up. He helped during a stressful situation
2035,5.0,Outstanding luxury resort,"Perfect for our 5yr anniversary , the views of the fountain and 5 star restaurants filled our hearts. Don was very accommodating and the hotel staff were friendly. The salon suite was spacious and classy."
2036,5.0,fantastic getaway,stayed for 4 nights in the upgraded stay well room at the top of the spa tower was great as well as being pickup after the free concert of Tim McGraw . Room with good insulation even when the bathroom toilet makes big suction noise when being flush just like the airplane you don't hear it from neighboring room unless you're in the bathroom and it's not too loud either!
2037,4.0,Fountain View Is Worth It!,"Back to LV and Bellagio! Another awesome stay! Why do I love it? I love the location - it's centrally located. The hotel is well kept and the service is excellent. The rooms do need a little bit of updating. Our room was immaculate, but the decor could need a makeover - why I rated a 4. I upgraded to the fountain view, and it was worth it. My wife and I sat by the window at night, watching the fountain - it doesn't get old. The mid floors are the best because you look straight into the fountain. If you are too high, you will only view it by looking below. Another great stay and will return for sure!"
2038,3.0,Some things have changed,The property itself is beautiful and well maintained as normal but things have changed. Valet parking that you now pay 30/day was more of a headache and a wait compared to past experiences when it was free. Got tired of smelling weed in the casino and when you stepped out front. Felt as though Bellagio has taken a step backwards in few areas and need to get back to where they were at in the past. Seems they are more into making a dollar than to keep up the services and amenities that should go along with price increases.
2039,2.0,Paying for the name- NOT worth it.,"Came for my wedding and had nothing but problems since checking in. $700 computer glitch on top of the $2200 we paid for the most basic room. Staff tried claiming there was nothing they can do but wait 4 days to be refunded. Was heckled by hotel staff for nursing my 20 month old on the floor even though there was no adequate seating. Everyone in my bridal and wedding party stayed at cheaper locations and had a MUCH better experience than us. The hotel rooms are ok- outdated. You’re pretty much paying for the name and the convenient location on the strip. After seeing my in-laws room at the VDARA which is right next door, i was shocked. Full kitchen and view of the fountains and entire strip for about a quarter of the price. Not impressed, actually pretty disappointed."
2040,5.0,NCAA stay,This was a last minute stay. I called my host who took care of everything. The staff and everyone in the casino was so friendly. I would highly recommend the Bellagio Las Vegas and will be back soon. I am looking forward to it.
2041,5.0,Excellent service!,We are so please with the good quality service they provide during our visit. We love the food and the room. Very professional and outstanding hotel. I really appreciate your hard work and your assistance. So enjoy everything! Keep up your amazing job 😊😊😊😊
2042,5.0,Spoil yourself,Husband and I spent our 20th anniversary here. We loved every minute of it. Wonderful room and excellent service. The entire property is as beautiful as the lobby. There are no bad views from the hotel.
2043,4.0,Business Trip to Las Vegas (with a few extra days),Love this property! It is so beautiful. The spa is quite large. The water show is lovely. The Stay Well floors are an excellent idea. The bed was very comfortable. I even enjoyed the old school music I coud hear as I walked on the breezeway to leave the property.
2044,5.0,Bellagio,Room was out dated but clean. Check in and out was easy. Don’t touch anything in the fridge you will be charged!! The smell of real flowers is amazing. Be prepared to walk a lot! The O show was awesome!
2045,4.0,I Expected Better Overall,"Room was close to service elevator and very noisy. It sounded like airplanes taking off all night and morning. Lady at the front dest was rude when we arrived early, even though we asked for early check in."
2046,3.0,It’s ok,There is not a lot of amenities to be offered. Even if you want to grab a water or coffee there just is not a lot of shops in the hotel that offer this. If you book a certain room like the fountain view it does not mean you are guaranteed to get it when you arrive
2047,4.0,Baby moon trip,A very beautiful hotel that was very aesthetically pleasing. The hotel accommodations were top notch for sure. The AC in the room didn’t work the best but we made the best of the stay. The stay at one of the restaurants gave us less than great looks whenever walking into the room due to is not being in suit and tie I guess. They asked if we wanted to look at the menu whenever we asked for a table and wouldn’t respond whenever asked how there evening was going.
2048,5.0,Incredible luxury!,"Our suite was worth every extravagant penny! There are no words to elaborate on the staff and accommodations of the Bellagio. It could, however, use a few settees in the lobby while you wait for someone or your driver."
2049,5.0,Meeting at the Beliagio,"The Bellagio is a great place for a meeting. large rooms, excellent A/V available. Rooms are clean and well appointed. I paid extra for the fountain view room (17th floor), but be aware from 10pm to 2 am the music from the night club is loud and you may have a hard time sleeping during those hours. Don't pay extra for the fountain view if you value your sleep. Get the view of the strip. Overall, it is one of the best places to stay."
2050,2.0,Not great,Outdated room and it's clear that the hotel is not the business' priority. Don't expect to have decent breakfast unless you've made reservations and in room dining might arrive with a 90 minute delay. It's just not good for the price per night.
2051,2.0,Shower would not drain,Shower drain was plugged upon arrival and nearly overflowed onto bathroom floor each time so shower length was cut short. Took nearly 1.5 hours to drain enough for another shower to be able to be taken. This should not occur in a luxury hotel.
2052,5.0,We love Bellagio...,"We celebrated our one-year Anniversary we had an amazing stay with Bellagio, the Penthouse was incredible. Bellagio employees make you feel very pleasant and very professional and made you feel welcome."
2053,4.0,Beautiful Room,"my room was courtesy of MyVegas, so basically i just paid the resort fee. With that comes the news that the location is NO WHERE NEAR the casino. quite the walk. As i am handicapped, it had to be a well planned trip to go to the casino or back to the room. Only went across the street once as that was almost too much. The only 'normal priced' food was a place called Snacks. Pizza, garlic knots, chicken strips etc. Good food, prices not too bad. the room was BEAUTIFUL. comfortable bed. The real issue was i billed my parking to the room, but exiting the structure, it said i still owed. I've called twice and emailed 3 times and nothing. That alone didn't ruin the trip but i'll think twice about billing to my room again"
2054,5.0,Fabulous place.,"Although it can be a little price, it is worth it. Bellagio has spacious rooms with comfortable beds. The casino and hotel are very easy to navigate. There are many fine dining options. The staff was friendly and available."
2055,5.0,Great Stay!,"We had a great stay at the Bellagio. Worth the price, we had a fabulous room, the view was outstanding! The service was excellent! Everyone was friendly and helpful! Everything is so beautiful at the Bellagio!"
2056,5.0,Best Choice on the Strip,"Upscale hotel that is centrally located with excellent restaurants, gaming, shopping and staff! Had an exceptional stay and was thoroughly pleased with every aspect of the Bellagio. Would enthusiastically choose the Bellagio again."
2057,5.0,Best Choice on the Strip,"Upscale hotel that is centrally located with excellent restaurants, gaming, shopping and staff! Had an exceptional stay and was thoroughly pleased with every aspect of the Bellagio. Would enthusiastically choose the Bellagio again."
2058,5.0,Donald Paul,"The accommodations were great. The best was soft. The lobby, restaurants and pool are beautiful. The food is great. The rewards program is confusing and doesn’t seem like it’s getting us much. But overall great."
2059,5.0,Quick Trip Success,"Quick weekend trip with wife and I couldn’t have asked for a better location, service, and company to stay with during this weekend. The location being central strip was absolutely perfect, room was very clean and fountain view was astonishing."
2060,4.0,Bellagio stay,"Hotel and room was clean and beautiful. Bed was super comfy. I gave it 4 out of 5 due to lack of affordable food options. We slept there and got room service for breakfast, which was decent. We went to other locations for lunch and dinner which seemed a better value."
2061,5.0,Honeymoon heaven,"We had a suite with a view and it was very clean, very spacious and staff were phenomenal. App check in made skipping lines a breeze and spa booking on the app was easy as well. Very very please with our stay for our honeymoon. Would definitely book again."
2062,5.0,Vegas Baby!!!,"Bella Bellagio!!! Genuine perfection, not the typical Vegas lipstick on a pig. I’ve been to Vegas 22 times and have stayed everywhere, Bellagio is by far the best of the best. Very very safe, great staff, gorgeous facilities, the pool is to die for. I haven’t slept that well since I was in my Mamas womb. That’s what you call a Hotel!! That’s Vegas Baby!!!"
2063,5.0,Best place to stay on the strip,"Great location, all the expected amenities for a place of its status, everything was great. First time we took out daughter to Las Vegas, and she had a wonderful time. Food was great, casino was much nicer even then we expected"
2064,5.0,Best Hotel in Vegas!,I had an AMAZING trip in Vegas at the Bellagio. The staff was extremely helpful. The concierge desk went above and beyond to help me when I lost my phone. I've never experienced this level of kindness at a hotel before. Another key favorite was seeing Whitney play the Piano at the Petrossian. Definitely a huge highlight of the Bellagio and of my trip!
2065,2.0,Go somewhere else,"We were very excited to stay at the Bellagio. Check in line was always about a 30 minute wait-- we had to stand in it 3 times. The room we reserved was not available. We settled for a different room for one night and moved the next day. I was told someone would call when our new room was ready. I ended up having to check back twice (yes, waiting in the line each time) because no one ever called. I was told well most people just check back so we didn't call. ??? Annoying, but hey, first day of vacation, it's fine. Get to the new room, the shower is a trickle. We had to wash our hair in the sink. No one wanted to go through the hassle of moving rooms again as we only had one more day in Vegas. The hotel is beautiful. However it smells horrible inside. Stale smoke"
2066,1.0,Room was disgusting,"Room looked like a party had been thrown and the staff didn't clean it up. Bed frame was destroyed, door handles broken, electrical socket torn our of wall, shower not cleaned, and we found blood on comforter."
2067,4.0,Bellagio Business Summit,"Great venue for a business trip. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes, lot of walking! Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating, meeting meals were good. There are plenty of great restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel as well."
2068,3.0,Average,Expectations were way too high for this property. Expected much more and left with just an average due to cleanliness issues. Encouraged to use VIP entrance but could not use the amenities unless you have a specific card. Was not told about that detail.
2069,5.0,3/31 Bachelor Party,"We vistited this hotel the last week. The staff were very great and quality service, so, the eat is varity and excellent , also the rooms were clean and confort bed. it has afantastic location for the people that visit the towon for work. Will recomendet thes hotel for all persons that to travel this city"
2070,4.0,Nice but VERY PRICEY,"The resort is gorgeous. Amazing decor and displays. Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for everything. The food is overpriced whether it’s in-room dining or an on-site restaurant. The website is a huge hassle with endless glitches. From booking spa appts to changing passwords, it was a nightmare. Overall the stay was pleasant with a few hiccups."
2071,2.0,Dirty room,"The room was dirty when I got in: no one ever came and cleaned mine or Replaced towels, no prices on the drinks and snacks in the room. No coffee pot in the room. I don’t plan to come back. Treasure island was a better experience"
2072,1.0,Experience,"For $389 a night, we had a view of a wall... The pool had short hours from 9-6 only and there was a line to get in. Not enough chairs. The coffee line was so long. We never could sit and listen to music and have a drink. You had to make reservations just to sit and have a drink. No casual meals either, very spendy"
2073,1.0,Overrated- a shell of its former self,"Not sure what is going on, but it apparently ok to have guests pay $1200++ a night for a suite (3 bathrooms, one bed?) that you can't get a roll-a-way delivered to without an act of congress. $22 for a water with no access to a drinking fountain, let alone a filtered water system like an airport? Is this legal? Do yourself a favor and spend the same money and go to the Wynn."
2074,3.0,Unlucky Slots,I usually always win or break even when gambling. Unfortunately not the case this time. It seems the slot machines don’t really pay. I noticed other gamblers saying the same thing. Hotel is clean and beautiful though. Awesome location on the strip.
2075,4.0,Great hotel. Poor service,"The hotel is beautiful. It’s pristine and modern. However, the hotel lacks the touches you would expect from a 5 star vegas hotel. The service isn’t great. They charge a delivery fee for room service which I think is insane. There is a charge for opening the door of the mini bar- literally just opening the door. It feels like the hotel is too big to manage well. The hotel itself is in a great location and is absolutely beautiful!"
2076,5.0,Impromptu Getaway!,We decided at the last minute to plan this getaway and the Bellagio did not disappoint! Clean Casino with amazing shops and easy access to walk to other casinos. Staff was wonderful also! The Hotel ambiance is breathtakingly beautiful!
2077,5.0,Five diamond experience,"You get what you pay for! The best of the best. A classic hotel with a modern upscale experience! The service, room, food, gaming, and entertainment is all perfect. It’s no wonder even though this hotel is over 20 years old but still so popular. Best location on the strip in my opinion. Once you go Bellagio, you can’t go Caesars."
2078,3.0,No longer one of the nicest properties on the Strip,"The Bellagio USED to be the ""Go to"" for luxury on the Strip, now, it was not as nice. Check in was great, but their newly renovated rooms are NOT what is to be expected. Spend a little bit more and get WAAAYY more luxury at the Wynn. Also - the line for Valet and how Valet was handled all the way around, big disappointment."
2079,5.0,Opulent,"Beautiful and staff are wonderful. The electronic check in, out and key are a huge plus, no lines. If I had the money I would only stay at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. They also allow pets with an additional fee. my sister has two chihuahus' and it worked out perfectly. I loved this trip to Vegas"
2080,5.0,Bella Bellagio,"We just returned from Las Vegas and Highly Recommend the Bellagio. It is spacious, clean, and we love the bed! I'd highly recommend eating breakfast at the cafe shop near the pools, we went there every morning for a coffee and toasted bagel. There are many restaurants to enjoy and choose from and we especially enjoyed the french onion soup at Sardelles. The Bellagio always has excellent service when you are gambling also, you do not have to wait too long for someone to come and offer you a drink."
2081,5.0,Fun Getaway for Couples,"We had a great time. It was a beautiful place. The entire property was immaculate yet comfortable. The location is great if you want to stay on the property. However, unless you want to spend a lot for meals, you have to go off property (quite a walk)."
2082,4.0,Overall great experience,"The common areas of the Bellagio are fantastic. The botanical garden is always amazing, Good ventilation, so less smoke than other casinos. The spa tower rooms need refurbishments. Lovely pool areas, but need more servers of course!"
2083,3.0,Overrated,We stayed at the Bellagio for its central location on the strip and for its reputation. The location was great but the hotel was a bit of a disappointment. The room was nothing special and the shower set up was strange. It is a very long walk to your room from any entrance. No coffee is provided in the rooms and buying it from them was very expensive. We will not stay here again as the room was overpriced.
2084,5.0,Going back home,"It was a nice experience. Easy early check in, self parking was practical.a bit of walking beautiful and well maintain hotel, lots of activities Problem w making restaurant reservation and long wait to get seated"
2085,2.0,Totally Disgusting service,"What an absolute disgrace!! We paid USD $750 a night in this establishment only to not have our rooms serviced each day! Totally NOT serviced, at all. I booked two rooms for our stay, one for our kids and when we complained that their room wasn’t serviced, housekeeping attended, made one bed and left the other bed not made. Our room just simply wasn’t serviced at all even though we saw rooms next door and across the hall being serviced? When we contacted housekeeping We we’re told that they were not servicing rooms due to Covid. Then we were later told by check in desk, no that’s not correct, it is because they are at full capacity and they couldn’t service every room???. Then when we spoke to The Housekeeping Manager Paul, he said none of that is true and totally apologised and"
2086,5.0,Amazing stay as always,The only place we stay at when in Vegas. This time took the family and still amazing. Our family consisted of a toddler and a teenager. Staff is always courteous. Location is always clean. It’s in a great location. Being an MGM rewards member you get discounts (free to sign up!).
2087,5.0,Bellagio. The best hotel on the strip,"The Bellagio staff is Extremely accommodating. The Rooms are top notch . The Casino area is always clean. I wish there was a no smoking policy. Also I do realize that it is difficult to get new employees, however it is tough to find a hostess on the casino floor."
2088,5.0,Department: Essentials,Eloise Salinas was extremely helpful in helping us buy and gift wrap our purchase. Great variety in fashion accessories and chilled drinks. Very helpful staff and great overall service. Would definitely visit again!
2089,5.0,First time to Vegas,So Glad we picked the Bellagio for our first time ..ready to go back and of course ...stay at the Bellagio...top notch...first class and the fountain was amazing...oh by the way bed was wonderful...slept like a baby
2090,2.0,"Not what it is bragged up to be, no convenience for anything. Casino has very little pay out, no one was cleaning any","Machines were sticky. Server. Was rood when asking for a drink, sarcastically said you have to be playing. Most people were rood and snobby. Hand rails and doors were not cleaned the whole 5 days that I was there.The front desk told me I could pay 60 dollars for late check out, that way they would hold my luggage until my flight at 10 PM. That was not true."
2091,3.0,Worth the experience,"Room smelled like weed. Had trouble with the digital key. Room was overpriced for the “strip view” , more like “parking lot view”. Even when the HVAC was on, it was still warm in the room. Elevators were confusing"
2092,5.0,We love the Bellagio!,This was our third trip to the Bellagio and we had another incredible time. The staff is very friendly and the property offers many upscale amenities. The money spent was well worth it and we plan to return in October.
2093,5.0,Excellent,"Highly recommended for its location, cleanliness, service, and brightness. Easy check-in and check-out and access to many attractions and nearby restaurants. Walking distance to many shopping places and stores"
2094,1.0,Property is Tired,Multiple issues including room not being cleaned on two days. No hot water on three days. Reported after first day and still not resolved. Water streaming down in front of spa tower elevators and fans with cones in place for 3 days!
2095,3.0,OK,Room did not feel like a 5*. Lots of walking as we were at the end of the hall. Cleaning staff was not very accommodating or friendly - we ran out of toilet paper and received attitude to get a replacement. We did not have our room cleaned daily - maybe they should leave a care package at the room door.
2096,5.0,Bellagio,Rooms are very spacious and beautiful. Had a nice view of the pools from our window. Check in was easy and quick. 10/10 recommend bellagio for anyone looking for a fancier hotel in Las Vegas. Will definitely be back
2097,5.0,Stay at the Bellagio,"Service was excellent, the staff is friendly and helpful. The dining experience and shopping were unique and the over all Vibe was electric! This hotel is perfect for business meetings, conventions or weekend get-a-ways. The floral displays are beautiful, the glass-blown ceiling art is amazing and the overall value was perfect!"
2098,2.0,Too busy for good service,"Had to wait more than 4 hours past check-in to get our room and when we did, we walked into a strong weed smell. Front desk said only other room available was on a smoking floor. Sent up an air purifier that helped somewhat but weed smell was still present during our entire stay. The bellman who brought our luggage suggested that it was so common that the cleaning staff probably didn't even recognize it when they cleaned the room. Was disappointed that it was just suggested that this is typical service."
2099,5.0,Another Great Stay,"The Bellagio property is and probably will always be a must visit whenever I'm in Vegas. The ambiance, the restaurants, the shops and the decor makes this place one of the best Vegas has to offer. All of MGM properties seem to be cut from a different/much better cloth in comparison to other properties."
2100,5.0,Very Nice place.,"Clean and updated place with Great Staff. The additional fees tacked onto very high priced services was very irritating. Nothing worse than paying 180ish for a 50 min massage only to be told plus extra fees, oh and none of that includes a tip"
2101,2.0,Sister trip,Great beds but we experienced some negative guest services. We needed clean towels and waited for an hour but never got any. The guest relations gave some lame excuse and was able to come and give us towels 5 hours later
2102,3.0,Below par experience at Bellagio,"Purchased multiple rooms and suites for my son's 21st bday. Spent over $8K on rooms for 2 nights. Check in was poorly staffed - long wait. Furniture in rooms had noticeable scratches. Carpet had noticeable stains. Minimum Room service charge of $100. We were charged $5/glass (plus delivery and service charge) to have room service bring wine and cocktail glasses for pre-party in our room. Felt nickel and dimed. Unless there is a change, I will be selecting other properties in the future."
2103,3.0,Rooms ok. Overpriced.,Rooms ok. Lady that checked me in was great. But after that I didn’t think much of the bellagio. Bar way overpriced. Vending machine empty and ice machine was broke. Very busy. To much. Table limits way to high.
2104,5.0,Home away from home.,"When picking a hotel in Vegas, the Bellagio is always on top of the list. The staff are friendly, the hotel is always clean and classy. Restaurants are great with excellent food and they’re not cheap with their pours."
2105,4.0,My experience,I wish I had a better view. I wish I had a balcony or jacuzzi. I wish the digital Key key worked . I wish the buffet served dinner. I wish the room had better light. I don’t have two hundred worth of words
2106,4.0,Great scenery and convenient,The scenes are breathtaking with the fountain and Conservatory Garden. Customer service are great. Shower pressure was weak. Marble floor can be hard and cold to some. Bed and pillows are soft. I'd prefer firm.
2107,5.0,"amazing hotel, room and staff","very friendly staff, fountain view room is fantastic! it was my first time in Las Vegas and I loved our room and the City! will come back soon....loved watching the fountain from our room, at night is even more beautiful!"
2108,3.0,Disappointing stay,"Mobile check in didnt work. Mobile check out didnt work from lobby, Both required long waits for manual assistance. Ironing board didn't have a cover. $22 bottles of water in room; Room was clean, however. Pillows very hard. HVAC always felt wamer than desired, though I had a west facing room."
2109,5.0,Excellent experience,"A great getaway for a couple. Wonderful food, shopping, pools, and very friendly staff. Very close to all events, concerts and other hotels & restaurants. Easy access to taxi & Uber. Clean throughout."
2110,1.0,Terrible disgusting stay.,First room had a wet floor that I found out when I stepped on carpet in bare feet. Did not offer a new room until I asked for management. Fake eye lashes in bath room 2 days in a row. Did not take out trash out of room(multiple in room dining containers). Did not clean room until I complained at 5 pm. Room service was cold and the cheesecake had mold and waited for over an hour for it. Terrible disgusting overpriced stay. Would never set foot in this place again. Terrible bar service at the $100 day pool chair rental all days except for one. Friendliness is a rarity at this hotel by most all staff. Save your money stay elsewhere and come by to see the fountains. Yellow tail Was great everything else at this hotel was awful.
2111,4.0,Bellagio fountain view king,"Clean, spacious, and updated room. Awesome view of the bellagio fountains. Bed was comfortable and shower was massive! Housekeeping was great and attentive to our needs. Only default was very dirty picture window."
2112,2.0,Check in ruined the trip,Promised a 1hr early check in to make a rsvp for something important and they failed to do what they promised even though other people walked right in. After waiting for hours and explaining this was the first time here we want a quiet room i was granted a connecting room over looking the parking lot. The room itself was clean and comfortable but the fact that the bellagio front desk staff did that was very discouraging to me who travels often and has been in contact with plenty of hotel staff. The check in ruined the entire trip because we missed our plans and i was willing to pay for an early check in and i was told no need because the room was rushed but if we wanted we could pay for a 2 bedroom suite for me and my wife.
2113,4.0,Nice,I would stay here again just want better service at Check-in. The room was great and clean. The remote draping was every. Conveniently located Right in the heart of the strip. Poolside Cafe was great. The room service and the bag it came in was great.
2114,3.0,Beware of which Tower room is in,"Make sure you don't stay in the Spa/Salon tower. Rooms are dated, loud (hear the club base from across the street until after 2am) and showers are like staying at the Holiday Inn. Needs renovation. Friends that stayed in the other Tower loved it."
2115,5.0,A 21st Birthday,Staying at the Bellagio added to the excitement and memories we made celebrating my daughter’s 21st birthday. From the room to the food to the fountain everything about the Bellagio added something that my daughter and I will cherish forever! Thank you for a weekend that we will talk about and remember for a long time!
2116,5.0,Black Enterprise conference,The venue was well maintained; staff was courteous. Room layout was comfortable and modern. Convenience of two bathrooms. Stayed 3 days. The food was average; needs improvement . The views were spectacular.
2117,5.0,Great place to stay in Vegas,"First time staying here. Great experience! Loved everything about it, room, casino, the show O!! Had a fountain view room, did not disappoint. What a view of the fountains!!! Staff is so friendly, housekeeping to all the places we are."
2118,5.0,Personable Pitt Bosses,"While everyone's intention is to make money (or not lose) when gambling, you want to enjoy your time in a casino in a relaxed and friendly environment. I found the staff in the blackjack pit at Bellagio extremely personable and attentive to me and my family's needs throughout our stay. With the thousands of people that pass through these tables every week, our guy Mark Sirota was extremely accommodating and remembered our names throughout the trip. Looking forward to our next trip back."
2119,5.0,Beautiful hotel with friendly staff.,Stayed in the Spa tower with a beautiful view of the strip and the fountain. Room was clean and serviced every day. Lovely pools. Had an excellent meal on the terrace at Spago. Slots and the digital horses were fun!
2120,5.0,Best Host in LV,"You must find Bob Regan and call him if your a gambler. Best host I have ever had, I’m committed to this hotel over the other MGM purely because of him. The word no does not exist in his vocabulary. Very happy!"
2121,5.0,Excellent Stay,"I was there for the Black Enterprise Women's conference and the staff and hotel was amazing The room was clean, nice and I had a nice view of the water fountain and the water show. The restaurants were both friendly with regards to staff and the food was good especially at Yellowtail."
2122,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous hotel,"After 2 1/2 years of this Covid nonsense,decided to return to Vegas to celebrate my 53rd birthday.Splurged and chose Bellagio and got a fountain view king room.The hotel is GORGEOUS throughout! The conservatory is a must see and is absolutely beautiful.You can smell the flowers from the lobby.The room is large and they were recently renovated! Large bathroom with a huge walk in shower,and his and her sinks with gorgeous lighted mirrors! AND THE VIEW! Was on the 27th floor,and you can see the entire lake for viewing the fountains! Plus beautiful view of the Strip with the Eiffel Tower from Paris,the Coamopolitan,Ballys,as well as the High Roller ferris wheel! Had a first date dinner with a beautiful lady at Spago! Food and service is excellent! Fabulous time!!"
2123,3.0,"Good service, classy amenities. Bad billing and tech support.",My room was terrific but they're billing practices are deceptive. Make sure you have hundreds available on your account because it's a 150/day hold. They say nothing gets charged til check out That's a lie. All this caused them to max out my card then lock me out of the room. It took hours and many trips to the front desk to resolve. They credited me 100 bucks which covered 2 days of the resort fee. That said if you have the money there's really good staff and amenities.
2124,5.0,Fantastic Stay,From the state of art rooms to the friendly staff and mobile check in . You are treated with respect and as person not just a member number. You will feel welcome every time you step foot in the Bellagio
2125,5.0,Bellagio continues to impress.,My recent business trip to Las Vegas was enhanced by the excellent service provided at the Bellagio. The room was very comfortable and well appointed. The property is spotless and remains as one of the most beautiful on the strip. As always the fountain shows were fabulous.
2126,5.0,Business trip,Sophisticated and comfortable feel. Staff are friendly and informative. Not too friendly on payouts but I a good stay. Can’t win every time. Overall happy I stayed. Enjoyed the fountain show as always. Can’t express how clean this place is. Even power washed the drive entry and walk ways one night I was there. Class above the rest.
2127,5.0,As close to perfect as there is,The Bellagio property has it all. Our first time staying there and will not be our last. I especially enjoyed the poker room and the private cabana we rented at the Cypress pool. Staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating
2128,5.0,Bellagio Las Vegas,"One of the top resorts in Las Vegas. Great location, very beautiful with elegant details. It is a couple decades old, but you would not know it. There is much to see and do at this resort, the staff is friendly, its very clean and flowers everywhere."
2129,1.0,Stay Away!,"You would be better off playing at the airport. Poor service, slots set on ""Do not Pay."" This place has to have the worst win/loss ration on the strip. Understaffed in every way, overpriced food, stingy portions, poor service, poor customer service. Save yourself the aggravation and go to another hotel and casino. There are better hotels, better restaurants, better casinos and better staff members as close as next door or head in any other direction to another casino."
2130,5.0,Wonderful stay,The Bellagio exceeded our expectations. The rooms were exceptionally clean and well appointed. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The grounds are beautiful. We look forward to another visit in the near future!!
2131,4.0,Cost of food,"If you are planning on grabbing a quick bite at bellagio you better be prepared for outrageous prices for water and soda.also the cost for a simple 4"" sandwich is crazy.be prepared for cost or to travel elsewhere on the strip"
2132,5.0,The best place to stay hands down,The Bellagio is my top pick anytime I am in Vegas. The fountain is something I really enjoy watching but the conservatory is something that everyone needs to see. They change it all the time but its always a treat.
2133,2.0,Overrated,"This hotel has really gone downhill. I’m in Vegas a lot this time for a convention. Room was just ok, expected more from Bellagio. AC didn’t work well, small TV and lots of noise in the hallway. The gift shop is out of control. $7 for a Gatorade. It’s just not what it used to be."
2134,5.0,"Bellagio, a lovely hotel & casino.",I love Las Vegas. I've been coming to Las Vegas for many years and I find the Bellagio is one of the nicest Hotel / Casinos on the strip. I also enjoy the wide range of food and snack options on the casino floor.
2135,5.0,BELLAGIO IS THE BEST,"Excellent customer service, very clean rooms, casino floor is exciting and enjoyable, beautiful pool and gardens, security staff were very professional and courteous, we felt very safe. Overall a very positive experience. Thanks"
2136,4.0,"Large, Non-Personalized Hotel","My wife and I stayed one night in early March 2022. We booked through Amex FHR. Service was non-personalized (which isn't a surprise given the hotel's size). We were upgraded to a room with a view, not a suite. The $100 food and beverage credit also was not applied to gratuity, which is frustrating and not consistent with other properties."
2137,2.0,Poor/ unsatisfactory,"I ve stated enough reasons why me and my wife were very displeased with this hotel stay. I wish that we had a greater experience. I was pleased with the view of the fountains from the room but I know we paid for that experience and lastly the only good experience was the ""O"" performance at circus delolay"
2138,5.0,Class Act,"We received excellent service throughout our 4 night stay which was a comp given to my mom. The beds were extremely comfortable compared to other resorts I’ve stayed at. The room was larger than I am used to. Machines were tight sometimes, other times they were fun. My mom had good luck playing, so that’s the way it goes. Overall it was a wonderful vacation."
2139,5.0,Home away from home!,Gorgeous hotel and the staff was amazing the entire time. while visiting be sure to book a spa day the experience is unforgettable. If you want a view get a Fountain view suite you won’t regret it!!!!
2140,4.0,The bartender wasn't that nice and his drink that he made wasn't good at all even after i asked him to redo it,Not happy with the bartender at the pool not the cafe he wasn't nice at all. Not the cafe those ladies were very kind and sweet. I still will come bk i love this hotel and being honest that and the smoke is my only complaint.
2141,3.0,MGM Doesn't Reward Loyalty!,"MGM has demoted all MGM Rewards members and the Bellagio doesn't have any interest in supporting their loyal patrons in efforts to reinstate pre-COVID status for their customers. We have stayed at an MGM property in Vegas at least twice a year for the past 18 years with the exception of the COVID shutdown period, but that apparently doesn't mean anything to the Bellagio or MGM. Additionally, they apparently haven't recovered from COVID themselves yet. The Bellagio's idea of good customer service these days is TERRIBLE! Suffice it to say that, if you pay for something at the Bellagio, don't expect the Bellagio to deliver on what you paid for. We'll be staying at other than an MGM property from this point forward."
2142,5.0,Outstanding,"This hotel is outstanding. The staff, cleanliness, and amenities are awesome. We went to other hotels and did not experience the same level of cleanliness. The pools were great, amenities were great here! Thank you"
2143,3.0,Nothing specia-l but too expensive.,"They nicole and dime you for everything. Including water, which should be free in your room. $22.00 for a cheap bottle of water. That is ridiculios. Did expect much more amenitIies for the crazy price I paid per night, Won't be coming back. In addition, they try selling you a more expensive room during check in."
2144,5.0,Beautiful Views,One of the nicest hotels on the strip. Staff was friendly. All areas of the hotel are clean. Pools areas was relaxing. Spa was overpriced but didn't expect it not to be. Location was perfect. The room was a bit warm but was our own fault since we chose not to make time to complain.
2145,2.0,Overpriced,"Was impressed when first arriving at hotel, then at reception was told had to pay an extra €51 resort tax a night on the room!! Was told not to pick anything up in the fridge as it’s all motion censored and would get charged!! No tea/ coffee facilities water in room was $22 a bottle!! So had to go to a bar/coffee shop down stairs and pay $6 for a coffee each morning! Bought a bucket of beer( 5 cans)and 2 cokes when we were around the pool $72!!!, nothing was complimentary everything had a cost an expensive cost, when checking out, you leave your bags with the bellboy but there is no room where you can freshen up if you have a long wait, I seen people brushing there teeth and washing in the restroom toilets, I also complained about the dirty/streaky windows in the fountain view"
2146,1.0,Housekeeping won't come everyday if you do not tip them,"I stayed at many 5 stars hotels in the past. For the first time in my life, at Bellagio, I don't have housekeeping service everyday. At first I thought they just missed it somehow, but it happens again and agin, I was so curious on why, cause I know nowadays hotels worldwide have system to keep track on which room was cleaned and which was not, its impossible to miss. After doing some research, I found that American usually would tip the housekeeping on a daily basis. I am from Asia and we have no such culture on tipping housekeeping at all. I am very surprised that housekeeping in Bellagio can actually decide themselves whether or not to service a room based on whether or not there will be a tip left in a room."
2147,5.0,Birthday Get Away,I first stay here back in 2014 and it was just as great in 2022. I paid the upgrade for the fountain view rooms on both visits and hope to return in 4-5 months to do the same. Front desk was awesome with the ease of checking in. I really like the making of your room key area and checking out over the in room tv. Overall the stay was awesome for this young man turning 56 lol. See you again in a couple of months.
2148,5.0,As Always Bellagio doesn’t disappoint,This trip we tried the Yellowtail and Mayfair Restaurants. Excellent experience. The rooms are always clean and smell nice. The views are unbelievably gorgeous. Always a pleasure to stay at Bellagio. The new rewards system looks promising as well.
2149,3.0,This place sucks,"They charge for everything in the hotel room, housekeeping staff will keep bothering you even if you have a late checkout (4pm), they can’t even provide the basic items like a mini fridge on your room without all the overpriced items they try to get you to buy, slot machines are soooo tight and doesn’t pay crap, only good thing is it’s on the strip and convenient to get to wherever. Cosmopolitan was a lot better than this casino and wished we would’ve booked our stay with them again."
2150,5.0,Hotel room,Great experience. Even that it was a complimentary room the service was still the same. There is so much to do and the shoots machine they have a great options. Also is in a great location whit a walking distance
2151,4.0,"Beautiful hotel, strong smoke smell","I loved our room and the hotel in general, but the smell of smoke from the casino was really strong and my kids and I reacted to it. We actually wore our Covid masks when we had to walk through it to get to our rooms. I otherwise think it is a wonderful hotel"
2152,5.0,Business/ Relax.,I came out to Vegas for a Century 21 Convention. Stayed first 3 nights at another property in Vegas. My husband flew out for the end of the trip. We moved over to the Bellagio!! It was wonderful! I had been to the Bellagio prior but I wanted to treat my husband. We had a fountain view room. Enjoyed our stay. Easy to rent a car directly from the hotel. Everything was GREAT!!!! Bellagio is my go to Hotel in VEGAS!!!
2153,4.0,Love the stay!,"Clean, fun, and would come back for another stay. Service was professional, kind, and made sure we enjoyed our stay! 5 star stay for sure. Rooms were clean and beds super comfortable. Casino staff were very good!"
2154,2.0,Not happy,"Expected a much better room. Furniture so old and dirty. Restroom was so dirty. Everything is so old and scratched, was expecting much better quality. Carpet was dirty. Internet access was horrible as well."
2155,4.0,Booked a non smoking room and was assigned a smoking room,I booked a non smoking room. when arrived i was assigned a smoking room. I tried to bear it one night and it was horrible. I went to the front desk and ask to be moved to a non smoking room and all they had were stay well rooms so i was charged an additional 50.00 a night to be put in a non smoking room. other than that the stay was great.
2156,3.0,It was okay,Room was dated and not working especially for the price. The staff from checking in to housekeeping were amazing. The shows and dining were good. The Convention center was amazing for anyone looking to hold conventions there.
2157,4.0,Very Good,"Would recommend, to family friends and coworkers. The spring garden display was beautiful and great for beautiful pictures and memories, it also smelled great for their was fresh flowers on display. Love everything."
2158,2.0,March 2022 Visit,"What was once the premiere Strip property has declined drastically with respect to customer service, ambiance, and value. Overpriced rooms, indifferent hotel staff, rude dealers, terrible house rules, and a sportsbook dominated by uncomfortable seating / limited wagering option kiosks have made this place the embodiment of lipstick on a pig. The social scene is better at the Aria or Cosmo, the vibe is more refined at the Wynn or Encore, and the restaurants have been eclipsed by options just about everywhere. It's not 2003 anymore, so look elsewhere to spend your time and money while in Las Vegas."
2159,5.0,Great hotel,Location can not be beaten. Stayed in the stay well room. Room was very nice and had a great view of the pool. Had excellent dinner at lago outside by the fountain. Get the risotto. Wish table limits were lower on weekdays. Overall great experience and will be returning.
2160,3.0,Great fountain ok hotel room,Fountain view room was average. Felt room could have been cleaner. Casino was nice but overcrowded most of the time with many tables not in use. $60+ Daily Resort charge after paying for vacation. Drink prices at pool ridiculous. Location was nice as were fountain shoes.
2161,5.0,The Best of Las Vegas!,"We had an incredible time....Dinner at Le Cirque, Picasso and The Mayfair Supper Club. The accommodations were beyond our expectations....great fun! It was a bit cool outside, but we were able to take advantage of the pools one day."
2162,3.0,"Beautiful views, painful service","Massive hotel, beautiful lobby / atrium and commercial spaces. Room was great. Had a stunning view (stayed in a fountain view king in the newly renovated tower). Service is super painful and slow. - Room service takes a minimum of 60 minutes and they are always backed up, regardless of day / time. - To get a person on the phone for anything — concierge, salon, room service, you will be on hold for 20-30 minutes (for real, with room service being at least a 30 minute wait to get them on the phone to place the order). - Front desk is nice but can’t do basics (pre-paid early check in, late check out) without a manager. These guys need an app like the four seasons so you never need to talk to one of them to put requests in. Final note — this place is beautiful but overly"
2163,5.0,Fun weekend,Experience at the Belliago. The only place we stay when in Vegas. Love not having to wear masks again. Only issue is the smoking. Which is not the resorts problem. Loved the flower garden. Christmas and spring have the best flowers.
2164,3.0,"No coffee in room. Beware of hidden costs (just touching mini bar contents: $16.50 each time, or $50 for personal use)!!","No coffee in room. Long Line to get coffee. Hidden costs : just touching bottles in mini bar:$16.50 (there are sensors) or $50 for personal use. Resort fee per day for no service whatsoever. BUT, hotel is great and well kept Pool area is lovely"
2165,4.0,Bellagio was beautiful,The place was really nice the machines were very tight and the restaurants were unbelievably expensive don’t plan on eating for less than $100 a couple unless you’re having pizza at the snack bar for $50. The food was fancy but the taste was not there for the money we paid to eat we even ate at noodles thinking that would be a cheap meal and it was over $200 for four of us. Replace is very nice but easily paid for with their tight machines
2166,5.0,Great Place to Stay in Vegas,"From check in to check out, our stay at Bellagio was great. The room was great. The staff was great. We loved the Pattisserie for breakfast. Also, we liked that Bellagio was centrally located on the Strip. Only problem was all the money I left in your slot machines. LOL"
2167,1.0,Don’t waste your money!,"Expensive without the expected service. It’s like staying @ a cheap hotel. Room service takes forever, rooms are okay… nothing special. Attended a gala and the staff were poorly trained. Save your money & stay at a different resort. Casino was also super smoky."
2168,4.0,Bellagio 2022,"Booked the hotel far in advance and paid way more than usual for a special occasion. The Strip View Salon Suite was a corner room (21st floor) in an older part of the hotel. Room was spacious, decent bathroom and bed. The couch was terrible, stained, and disgusting. For the price we were disappointed to say the least. We have stayed at many properties over the last 20 years and this was our first stay here. Limited placed to eat or get snacks late. Tables were good. I alway laugh at raising the minimum to $50-$100. Keep them low, more people will play and gladly give you their money without feeling robbed. We stayed Friday Saturday Sunday nights. The music at the property next door was so loud it kept us up till 3am. Wanted it to be memorable but fell way short. Property needs"
2169,5.0,Excellent,Great location and excellent services. Amazing decoration. Super clean and neat. Friendly staff from front desk and concierge.I want to become a shareholder of MGM and I am planning to buy some MGM stocks .
2170,5.0,Genuine to the core,"Our room was furnished so nicely and literally blew us away. Our son who is an interior designer always says, ""A space should speak to you and make you happy and peaceful if it is designed correctly. With the Italian town of Bellagio on Lake Como as its inspiration the Bellagio spoke to us in so many beautiful ways. The service at Spago by our waiter Paul Anthony was simply amazing!! We love you Paul. On our special evening, the hostess provided us with a table on the outside terrace and was very gracious and the service was off the charts as the whole team was incredibly attentive. My wife loved the bathrobes that are provided and the beds were the best ever...so comfy and no noises!!"
2171,5.0,Excellent stay,"Great rooms, staff and amenities. Would definitely recommend to anyone looks for a place to stay pretty much central strip. Everyone from bell hop to player’s rewards desk were very friendly. Prime steak house patio dining was top notch that was 5 stars alone!"
2172,5.0,Best of Vegas,The Bellagio is the best resort in Las Vegas. The Bellagio’s service and choice of restaurants are exceptional. The suites at the Bellagio are well appointed and love the steam shower. I recommend it when any asks.
2173,3.0,So So,This hotel is not what it used to be - won’t be back. Coffee availability not good - no place to have a quick bite on the way to a show. Felt like the property was trying to make up for lost time - parking was always free - not the value it used to be
2174,2.0,"Good from far, but far from good","Used mobile check-in. Both the physical keys and the digital keys didn't work, resulting in having to stand in line for nearly 30 minutes and almost missing dinner reservations. I suggested proactively diverting guests from the Mobile Check in desk to working with an actual person until the Mobile Check-In issues are resolved, which clearly annoyed the Front Desk Clerk. Lago Restaurant: The initial food brought to us was not what we ordered. When addressing this with the waiter, he was extremely rude. Parking: It is supposed to be free for MGM Pearl members and higher tier. Despite properly entering my rewards card, I was still charged, then later stood in line for 20 minutes to speak with the front desk to get the charge removed. Housekeeping: No housekeeping services for the"
2175,3.0,Not great for the price,"This property is getting outdated, and the property is not being maintained like a 5 star resort. service is not exceptional and nothing close to a five star resort. staff treat you more like an inconvenience not like your staying at one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. The pool area had nothing going on even on the weekend. They fell short on customer experience and Not what I would expect for the price"
2176,3.0,Slightly Below Expectations,"Could have been better. Many standard items in average hotel rooms were missing such as bottled water, extra blanket, Lysol spray, a plastic bag for the ice bowl, or floor mats on the bathroom. I found the soaps, lotions were kind of cheap as well. You’re paying a luxury price, but not for a luxury experience."
2177,1.0,Appalling service at hotel check in.,Reserved well in advance a non smoking ADA room with nearby room for additional family. Arrived at check in and were advised the only ADA room was smoking. We requested change to regular NON smoking with 2nd room nearby for family. We were PROMISED early check in for the family (2 young kids). Early check in did not happen so they had to wait in lobby until 3:00 when they should have been using the pool. (The pool facility was the reason we chose Bellagio.)
2178,4.0,Great Stay at the Bellagio,"My family and I had a great experience at the Bellagio. Great Cirque Du Soliel show, great dining and professional staff. An amazing resort experience. You spend good money on a trip like this and hope for a great outcome. We got it."
2179,5.0,Great Place to Stay in LV,I stayed at the Bellagio because it was convenient to the conference being held downstairs. The stay was exceptional from the time I got out of the taxi to when I got back in to return home. The room I was in had sweeping views of the Strip as well as the pool area. The fountain display will stop you in your tracks. Last but not least the floral display in the atrium was beautiful day or night.I look forward to going back.
2180,1.0,Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Please read this review. They miss sell the rooms!!,"Where to begin. Firstly, don't waste your money and stay elsewhere. We checked in and was a surprise trip for my fiance for his birthday. First time in Vegas & first time at the Bellagio. Only staying 1 night. Lady at check in said due to the occasion she would send up a free bottle of champagne. We got up to the room and 45mins had gone, no bottle. We wanted to head out but was mindful that if we did, the champagne would be warm if we returned later on. I called & was told there's no record of the champagne being requested. Asked for them to find out & call me back. Never did. I called again and they said the champagne was lodged now and would be with us soon. We ended up going out as wasn't impressed with this service, nor the state of the room we were miss sold. TV also"
2181,4.0,Great as long as you don't mind paper thin walls,Pretty sure a porno was being filmed next door at 6 am. Had to call the front desk after 30 mins of the actress faking. I do not enjoy the paper thin walls that early in the morning. I just wanna sleep :(
2182,5.0,"Highly recommended, warm hospitality, immaculate","We've been spending our vacations twice yearly at the Bellagio Las Vegas for more than 10 years. We've always enjoyed our stay as the staff are always friendly and polite, the rooms are immaculately kept and the whole complex is well taken care of. The staff are continuously cleaning, sanitizing and making our stay welcome."
2183,1.0,Trip to vegas,Upon arrival reservation could not be found delaying my registration. I paid for a pool view and was given a view of the roof and walls. Bed and pillows were extremely uncomfortable costing me and my family two nights sleep . Room temperature was either freezing or hot and humid but never comfortable. Few options of food varieties for younger families.
2184,5.0,The Pool’s Cool So’s My Room,"It’d been a few years since I’d stayed at The Bellagio. I forgot just how wonderful a place it is. The pool area is unsurpassed with large comfortable lounge chairs, beautiful landscaping, multiple pools and exceptional Bloody Marys. Even the towels are extra nice. My room was in the spa tower. It was huge, comfortably appointed and very clean. The bathroom was also huge with a great shower AND a Jacuzzi tub. Don’t know why I’d stay anywhere else."
2185,1.0,Underwhelming for the cost,Caesar's Palace is a lot more friendly and more bang for your buck. We won't stay here Again. We had a stained comforter and dirty towels in our room. If you're a POC be prepared to prove you have a room there before you enter elevators - showing your key won't be good enough for security.
2186,4.0,Beautiful property but the cigarettes YIKES,If it was cigarette free I would have been so happy! The rooms didn’t get cleaned every day and the food was surprisingly bland. But the location and fountain view made up for the food. Nothing can make up for the cigarettes though.
2187,5.0,The Perfect Vegas Hotel,The perfect spring getaway for my husband and myself. Loved the grounds of the hotel and the quietness of the mornings. Had the best sushi at the Yellowfin restaurant. All restaurants and cafes on the resort are amazing. Would stay here again 100%.
2188,5.0,Unforgettable Stay,First time to stay at this hotel and I'm impressed with the room that we stayed. It was huge even with one King bed. It's very clean and the view is awesome from the strip. The staff are friendly and approachable. There's no refrigerator in our room and we need one and the housekeeping was kind enough to bring one soonest.
2189,3.0,complaints,"Casino odds continue to be less player friendly and favor the House. In blackjack, It is very difficult to find a table that pays 3:2 or doesn't hit soft 17's. Table limits on tables that are more player friendly have increased dramatically."
2190,5.0,Fountain Views and Great Views,"Even after all this time the Bellagio is still one of the vey best on the Las Vegas strip. As an MGM Gold/Hyatt Globalist the dedicated lane to check-in made things very easy. I was able to get into my room at 2:30 pm just a bit before official check-in. I had booked a fountain view room and it was absolutely worth it. By far one of the best views and I would strongly recommend paying the premium for the view. I had room 16050 which seemed to be dead center to the fountains. Strongly recommend it. The hotel was full when I was there and so all of the restaurants had very long waits. Thus, it was necessary to have reservations just about everywhere. Other than that the staff at the hotel is great - everyone is so helpful. Great stay and I look forward to another visit."
2191,5.0,So worth it!,Especially loved longtime bartender Mark! He’s got game - the real deal - and a great human🤓the casino floor and lobby has good ventilation making it much less smoky. Will definitely stay here on next visit!
2192,5.0,Everything about Bellagio was perfect,"Must stay location if you’re going to Vegas. We’ve been a couple of times and the Bellagio was hands down the best! From the rooms to gambling, it was all the more than we expected. Highly recommended and can not wait to go back."
2193,3.0,"Terrible neighbors, no soundproofing","Was visiting for work and was unlucky and got terrible neighbors playing music into the early morning. While security did attempt to resolve, I was awaken two consecutive nights to extremely loud music. It’s obvious there’s no soundproofing in the rooms and the hotel was “full” per the staff and I wasn’t able to move. Made for two exhausting work days as I was traveling on business. Great hotel for pleasure and the party crowd but not ideal for business travel."
2194,2.0,Club music,"Although most everything at the hotel and casino is very nice, I would not stay there again. The Outdoor Club music accross the street makes it impossible to sleep at night. Music goes on until 3:00 AM."
2195,5.0,March Madness,"Awesome trip, we were treated like royalty from the time we checked in at valet to the time we checked out. The Bellagio goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is a good as it can be. The location is near the center of the strip which makes it easy and quick to get to other properties."
2196,5.0,Great place to stay,"We had an awesome time at the Bellagio, service was awesome. The rooms in the new tower, whoa. Shower just like home!!!!would highly recommend this spot and walking distance to so many great places!!!!"
2197,5.0,"Clean, Elegant, Friendly","Good casino, good show, nice rooms, everything you could imagine and more! The rooms were clean and spacious with amazing views, the staff was all friendly. My 1st trip to Vegas and couldn’t have picked a better place to stay."
2198,5.0,Best in Vegas!,"Centrally located, visually stunning, top shelf customer service. We were treated like VIP’s! Would highly recommend to others and will be planning a return trip later this year. Bellagio is our new go-to!"
2199,3.0,3 night Bellagio stay,Overal the experience wasn’t bad. For some reason out of the three nights we were there the room was only cleaned one time. We also paid for early check in and the room was not ready around 11A when they said it would be.
2200,5.0,Back to Vegas,The Bellagio shows no sign of it’s age. This is still a premier resort and casino. The staff is exceptional no matter what service or question you ask of them. Dining choices were amazing and the shopping was first class. The pool area and staff are my favorite in Vegas Ive seen others complain about pricing but you get what you pay for. The Bellagio is well worth the price of admission.
2201,3.0,First trip to Vegas,The room was great. Bed was very comfy. Front desk.was not helpful when asking to upgrade or to help with charges I shouldn't have gotten . $600 was charged to my card and I don't know why nor did I know about it until I returned home . Was told mis I formation about charging things toy room which cost me MORE money upon check out
2202,5.0,Moms 89th birthday celebration,"The service at the Bellagio is top notch. We had a wonderful experience from our dinner at the “Prime” to the Cirque dul Soleil O show to the REALLY comfortable warm sleep we had. You lose yourself in their bedding. The Bellagio is a BEAUTIFULLY decorated, massive hotel. Everything we did at our stay in Las Vegas was at the Bellagio. Worth every penny."
2203,3.0,Be prepared to pay through the nose.,No reasonably priced dining options. Buffet closes at 3 and for a brunch is very pricey. Everything for dinner is very high prices. And don’t expect to win anything on the machines. They like to take your money.
2204,4.0,Overall great stay,"Had a great time at bellagio , the room and location were perfect. Had a hiccup at massage but the overall stay was great and restaurants were very tasty. We would stay at the hotel again and loved the view of the fountain show from our room"
2205,2.0,Very poor staff experience. Come to take photos and leave.,"Let me start by saying Bellagio is still impressive in its grandiosity and decor. Probably, one of the classiest hotels in Vegas out there. However, I wish the same could be said about the level of service. I stayed here twice in the past year and honestly not sure why I returned the second time (to give it a chance?). 1. Checkout experience #1. The staff member was particularly hard about applying a daily food credit I was entitled to. The terms & conditions clearly stated I could use the credit on the day of checkout while the staff was adamant giving “a valued MGMGold member” excuses as to why the credit cannot have been applied such as “I’ve worked here for X years and it’s always been like that”, “This is wrong” and so on. I had to escalate to manager to get at least"
2206,2.0,"Money, Money, Money","Hidden fees, no receipt and extremely expensive shipping for lost item = scam. At checkout we found they had added large fees, in additon to normal taxes. No information given in advance. Coming home, we found our creditcard had been charged twice. Might be correct, but the hotel failed to provide correct receipt when requested. Twice! Unfortunately, my husband left a jacket behind at the hotel. At first, he was happy that the hotel was able to locate hos jacket. Only to discover that the hotel would charge USD 208 to send this lighweight jacket to our home address. Norway may be far from Vegas, but not THAT far."
2207,5.0,Wedding Stay March 2022,"My wife and I stayed here for our wedding in March 2022. Despite having already booked a penthouse suite for our stay we were upgraded to a Lakeview 1 bedroom suite on check in which really made our wedding trip special and memorable for both us and our guests that came to celebrate with us. The Lakeview suites give you the best view of the fountains in Vegas and I can't say enough about how memorable it made our trip. That said, the room did have some issues. Firstly it was noticeably dated and a little worn, especially when compared to some of our guests' newly renovated rooms. For example, the wallpaper was peeling in one of the bathrooms, and one of the cabinets next to the mini bar fridge fell off when we opened it. There was also a noticeable sewage smell in both"
2208,5.0,"Amazing hotel with stunning decor, rooms, and service.","I have stayed at many Vegas hotels and this was, by far, my favorite, First class in every regard - from decor to flowers, to fountains, to service, to location. About the only negative is that Bellagio is not a secret and I had to share this lovely property with too many other guests."
2209,2.0,"Too crowded, too expensive.","I expected an expensive, beautiful 5-star hotel but we are sorely disappointed. It is over priced for what you get, every part of the hotel is over crowded and inconvenient. It feels more like Disney. They are so cheap as a hotel chain they don’t even provide room coffee - really? A $12 bottle of grocery store wine is $50 in the ‘convenience’ store? Don’t waste your money."
2210,5.0,Fabulous hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel with oversized, very comfortable rooms-including a nice sized bathroom. The pool area is gorgeous with lemon trees growing in the pool area- which has 4 pools (I think) and a couple of hot tubs. So nice to be able to walk down to the pool and get a lounge chair and an umbrella without having to rent it or wait in line to get one of the few chairs available (like at other hotels). The wait staff at the pool was attentive and friendly! Sadelle’s Cafe has a wonderful breakfast with a view of the conservatory which is always beautiful! My first visit to Vegas that I wasn’t ready to go home- mostly due to this hotel and its amenities!"
2211,3.0,Not a good value,"For what you get this is not worth the money. The room is nice, the hotel is beautiful, but no coffee maker, $50 charge to store something in the fridge, long lines to get coffee in the morning (or $20 room service). It’s nice, but you are overpaying if you stay here."
2212,5.0,Doing Vegas Right,"When you think of Las Vegas, you think of the strip. The lights, the glamor, the tiddies (come on, were all adults here)... and the Fountains. The Fountains at the Bellagio are majestic and beautiful and will leave you speechless. And when it comes to staying somewhere to make memories, you want the front row seats to this amazing attraction. But the Fountains are just the draw. The people, the service, the amenities, the food... They all bring quality and joy to an amazing experience... Basically, if you've never been to Vegas, start with a fountain view of the bellagio."
2213,5.0,Our Bellagio Stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay last week. Highly recommend using the app to check in to avoid the long lines that are possible. We aren't big gamblers, but the casino was clean and not very smoky. The guys golfed and I enjoyed the pool. Get down there before 10 to get a chair or you can reserve one. Our room was super clean. They did a great job every day cleaning. We recommend buying water and other beverages from the store to save money and keep in the room."
2214,5.0,Beautiful Hotel with Great Service,Guaranteed great place to stay in Las Vegas. The restaurants are pricey (as in most of the Strip) but very good. Busy casino but not deafeningly loud. Some good discounts and perks with an MGM rewards membership.
2215,5.0,The Best,Made our 25th wedding anniversary wonderful. Our first trip of mony more to to Las Vegas was what we expected and more. The Bellagio is a must for 1st timers or repeat visitors. The fountain is just an added bonus
2216,5.0,Great experience.,"From check in to check out the overall stay was excellent… The restaurants, the pool, and casino were all great…the staff was attentive in all areas of the property..one drawback was the ability to get a morning coffee without a long line. But aside from that all was good.."
2217,4.0,"Expensive, plenty of amenities, and noticeable security.","Upon checking in and out, the people next to me were questioning their bill, so I made sure to get a paper copy upon checking out to avoid any problems. The check in process is convoluted and over dependent on technology."
2218,3.0,ST Patricks Day weekend,"Our stay at The Bellagio was not as expected, the VIP check in was Fair at best . We never had house keeping once in the 3 night stay. Over all the Suites look to be tired and dated . Having the Cafe and Buffet and FIX closed really limited our late evening snack options to virtually ZERO"
2219,5.0,Spring Break 2022,"The Bellagio was the perfect choice for our Spring Break 2022 Getaway. We love Las Vegas but do not gamble. We wanted a nice, comfortable hotel with access to great restaurants in the center of the Strip. The gambling areas are tastefully laid out and never « in your face « . Although smoking is allowed in the casino, thé air quality was good. The pool area is amazing. We will definitely come back…"
2220,3.0,Disappointing,"Quick easy check-in with app but downhill from there. Room was pleasant however the shower head was a huge disappointment. Restaurant options were either closed, wait an hour + or have a reservation. Very smokey on casino/first floor. Spa was average and no food/beverage service was offered during treatments. To end our first night...loud music/noise reflecting off fountain view room until 2am+."
2221,3.0,"Beautiful property, service lacking","Honeymoon vacation and celebrating our birthdays. After 30 minute phone call booking through MGM and leaving note on reservation about my vertigo asking for room below 10th floor, we were assigned room on 30th floor at check-in. Only options were 27th floor suite not renovated or suite not as nice as what we booked. Asked for mini bar to be locked on 3 occasions and had to call twice for hairdryer. In room safe didn't work/lock. Beautiful property but service did not meet expectations of Bellagio reputation or price paid."
2222,2.0,Bad check in experience,"Front desk failed to let us know once our room was ready. When calling down to bellhop for our bags to be delivered, no one would answer the phone. When someone did, they said why did I get you and hung uo."
2223,3.0,"PLEASANT STAY,BUT WOULD WE RETURN HERE ….LIKELY STAY AGAIN THE VENETIAN","Little things I think make a difference in making a hotel stand out from the pack.Little gripes turn into bigger ones when either a) there are not addressed b) or just plainly ignored I.e forgotten….we stayed for 5 nights,it’s not cheap,but what is cheap are the toilet products labelled at the rear MGM resorts,the toilet paper is not as good as some public toilets,in fact it’s so bad we used tissues,adding more to the in hous3 costs by trying to be too cute and cut back on basics.Guest services…..there isn’t enough will on my behalf or time too spend on such a poor lot ,,,3 times,wrong directions,poor knowledge of the hotel,and plainly not calling you back when promised"
2224,5.0,Bellagio; the Best of the Best,"I have been up and down this famous strip for 23 years+. The Bellagiois the most breathtaking, clean, hospitable home away from home that you could hope for. Seven pools, spacious and crystal clean rooms more comfortable than sleeping on a cloud. Foods and desserts available to satisfy and exceed any expectation. The gambling is on fire and full of excitement. “O” is one of the best shows in Las Vegas history, Always sad to leave yet excited in anticipation of our next stay."
2225,3.0,"Expected More - Good Bed, Poor Service",We took a spring break vacation to Vegas and stayed at the Bellagio expecting great rooms and a nice experience. The desk staff was rude and and gave wrong info. The casino is the smokiest! I was disappointed by the lack of quick eats (like late night stuff). Our bed was very comfortable and the location is great but overall would choose another hotel next time.
2226,5.0,Bellagio,Was a great stay and food at Yellowtail was best ever. service superb. Overall cost was reasonable.Great choice of wines. Helpful staff. Easy check in and check out. Pool staff was wonderful and helpful and food at pool cafe amazing.
2227,5.0,Amazing beds,Guys. Best bed I’ve ever slept on!!!!(Room 2540 I think). I even have a TempurPedic at home!! I LITERALLY BOUGHT THE PILLOWS WHEN I ARRIVED BACK HOME! They’re a brand called Downlite btw. Upon arrival the lady at the check in desk asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for $50/ night to a fountain view room! We said yes. I really appreciated the 3pm late check our option. I really don’t think I’ll stay at any other Vegas Strip hotel.
2228,5.0,Beautiful.,"The Bellagio provides all the charm, fun and beauty excepted from a luxury hotel. Don’t miss the conservatory in the early morning peace a s quiet. Sadelle’s breakfast was delicious. We can’t wait to return."
2229,5.0,Bellagio still nr 1,My wife and I visited Las Vegas for a night from Sweden. I have been there before and therefore we choose it. It was as pretty as I remembered it and we had a lovely evening. Had a great meal at Yellowtail ( japanese). Staff and the location is second to none. A six star experience😀
2230,3.0,The service is no good at all.,The service is no good at all. checkin experience was very bad. I paid $1200 for two night. But still the experience was not good. The rooms are noisy. The customer service was very poor. I would expect much better service from five star hotel.
2231,5.0,Best Hotel! ❤️,Our stay at the Bellagio was incredible! The hotel was beautiful and the staff were so nice and very accommodating! We can’t wait to go back one day! We celebrated our 40th Wedding Anniversary at the Bellagio and the food at Michael Mina’s restaurant was outstanding. We definitely recommend this hotel! 😘
2232,4.0,"Amazing hotel and ambiance,well kept property,Housekeepers were great.","Just don't expect too much customer service. Most of the hotel staff we've encountered were lacking of smiles and cues.You would think since you are paying top dollar the service will be similar to the Four Seasons, but maybe it was just not our day? Will still comeback though due to the sense of security that you feel. Also we requested close to the elevator and ended up almost all the way at the end?maybe ask the Front desk to show you the floor layout before going up to the room.."
2233,2.0,Bellagio Executive Parlor Suite,Paid a lot of money for the Executive Parlor Suite and couldn’t check in until almost 5pm. Lots of wear and tear and broken things in the room. No microwave or utensils. Digital key barely worked. Was very excited to come stay but left disappointed.
2234,4.0,Great rooms with some minor TV issues,Overall the room and stay was great. The only issue was the TV in our room would not stay connected to any channel. It kept saying not authorized. It's was too bad since it was March madness so I could not watch the games from the comfort of our room. I did not complain to the front desk though so partially my fault.
2235,5.0,Great experience,"First time at the bellagio was incredible. Rooms where very nice, clean, staff was great, and the casino was immaculate. Good table games and fast dealers. Restaurants where great, Snacks burgers are wonderful. Next trip will include Bellagio or MGM"
2236,3.0,Time to find another brand.,"Bellagio Spa Tower with Strip View - view was terrible, could see the top of a parking garage and listen to idiots doing donuts on the roof Saturday night. Room was kind of beat up and well, kinda felt like we were staying at a marriott. AC on a sensor, woke up in pool of sweat every night."
2237,5.0,Amazing Hotel & Casino,"Great hotel and & casino, access to most luxury stores and amazing restaurants. Prime is a must, delicious steaks with a beautiful fountain view. Amazing service and elegant rooms. I would highly recommend Bellagio."
2238,5.0,Classic.,"We’ve stayed at the Bellaggio several years ago and it was fantastic as we had a view overlooking the fountains. Our 4-night stay recently had a fabulous view of the pools. The pools - open from 9am to 6 pm. All are heated. I had the spa to myself as I was there early. They should open the pools in the evenings. The casino– I felt very safe as staff is constantly disinfecting and cleaning the machines. Ashtrays were emptied regularly floors were swept and the slots perhaps I was lucky but I won $1500. And I meant I won I guess at about $200 and the machine went crazy. The shops Dash not much is changed still the very high end retail stores but still look glossy, glamorous and obviously expensive. But it was fun to window shop. One of my friends actually splurged almost 3000 on a"
2239,4.0,Bellagio review,Beautiful hotel and great restaurants. Check in process was not as good as we have experienced in the past. We had to wait several hours for our room and no one called to let us know that it was ready.
2240,5.0,Beautiful property,Beautiful hotel. High end and high class... great combination !! Cleanliness is a priority. The Service is outstanding. The attention to detail is everywhere. The concierge service is very accommodating. Dawn goes above and beyond. Bellagio is our favorite hotel in Vegas.
2241,5.0,Anniversary trip,Beautiful place! The customer service at every turn was amazing! The air was electric every where we went. Having dinner and watching the fountain show was mesmerizing. We recommend a stay here if you haven’t

2245,3.0,"Beautiful on the exterior, just another hotel on the inside","waitstaff at the restaurants walk around like zombies. No interaction other than to take your order. They do the minimum. I don't know why they work there and expect tips. I ended up going to other hotels to be entertained. And the room itself was average. However, the A/C barely blew any cold air. I would not stay again based on this alone. I ended up sweating in my own room"
2246,5.0,Just in town for the night,Had a terrific time.. Enjoyed myself and pillows are amazing! My view of the foutain was gorgeous. The room service is available and the food is delicious. I stay here everytime I'm in vegas. The location on the strip is perfect.
2247,1.0,Loud noise through common door with adjoining room,"Room had common door between adjoining rooms, presumably for a family needing two rooms. Loud conversation between people in adjoining room late at night coming through that door kept me awake. Felt more like a Motel 6 than a $400 hotel. Was really disappointed."

2249,5.0,Best hotel/casino in vegas,"Starting off with the room it’s clean, spacious, and had a a spectacular view. On top of that the in room dining was incredibly fast and the food was way higher quality than I’ve ever had for in room dining, then you pair all of that with the best casino/poker room in all of Vegas it’s kind of a no brainer to stay at the bellagio"
2250,5.0,Magnificent,"Excellent service and the entire property is amazing. One of the top three pools in Las Vegas and their water show is spectacular, especially at night. Their multiple pool deck is enormous filled with foliage such as huge Italian Cypress trees."
2251,3.0,Snobby Spa Desk Agent,Treated poorly by desk agent at spa while inquiring about services. Excited to try Buffet but it was horrible and tasteless. I would not recommend either the spa or Buffet. Most other staff members were courteous
2252,5.0,friendly Casino staff,Friendly Staff. Great restaurant's. The casino staff goes above and beyond. The Bellagio is still the most clean and classy hotel in Vegas. This was our 5th time staying at the Bellagio. We plan on returning before the end of this year. I strongly recommend if you plan to visit Las Vegas you won't find a better hotel than the Bellagio.
2253,5.0,A Wedding at The Bellagio,The Bellagio is beautiful. My son's wedding was held in the Courtyard. The wedding coordinator made sure everything was perfect. The reception was in The Harvest restaurant in the Bellagio. The food was delicious and the service was great. I would highly recommend the Bellagio for a destination wedding.
2254,3.0,Great Location and Friendly Staff,The location is great and the staff were all very friendly. Our room was dirty when we arrived and remained dirty during our week stay even though housekeeping came in every day. The buffet in the hotel was quite expensive but the food was Golden Corral quality. I do recommend the fountain view room.
2255,5.0,Magnificent,"Everything was great! The bars, the piano player, the room, security, restaurants and the amenities. I was able to access Fedex and completed all of the necessary business transactions I needed to complete."
2256,4.0,Business trip mixed with fun,"Overall, one of the nicer properties in Las Vegas. Very clean. Fantastic location on the strip. The Bellagio needs a few more dining choices for something quick / less formal for a quick lunch or dinner."
2257,5.0,Bellagio is by far the best,"Best hotel on the strip for sure. We walked into many hotels on the strip and Bellagio is by far the best and most clean and friendly. So many great restaurants, shops and things to do you literally don’t ever have to leave if you don’t want to. It’s super close to all the best spots and hotel staff are incredibly accommodating. Would def return to this hotel when back in Vegas. Worth the money. Make sure to rent a mini fridge if you need to keep personal beverages or leftover snacks/food as the one in the room is not meant for that."
2258,5.0,Great time!!,Enjoyed everything. It was beautiful and the room was great. The checkin was very easy and we were able to be on the same floor as our friends. Loved casino.The fountains were wonderful. The location was convenient.
2259,2.0,Not Recommended,"Too smoky, crowded and overpriced. Staff is wonderful but management needs to address some serious concerns. Table minimums on week nights, along with few open tables, lead to a poor gaming experience."
2260,5.0,Fountain Views,"We had a room overlooking the fountains. Such a gorgeous view. Couldn't have asked for a better one. The rooms were clean, spacious and very comfortable. I love the fact I can lay in bed and open the curtains to see the fountains going off!"
2261,1.0,Disappointing.,"We were so excited to host a very small wedding in one of the suites designed for business/entertaining. Unfortunately there were a couple of issues, like a broken ice machine and phone. The staff was very rude. I normally don't write reviews but I was so disappointed with the experience. Pick a different hotel, there are plenty and I'm sure they are nicer."
2262,3.0,3 Star @ Best,What glitters is no longer here. Moldy bathrooms and loose boards dropping on your feet. Check-in was ok and check-out was horrible. There are cleaner places to stay for the $$$$. Suggest a little bleach and vinegar for the shower and glue for the loose board.
2263,1.0,Horrible,Broken TV. Staff is awful very uncomfortable to much money for poor service. Poor buffet poor cleaning staff little to no security parking is a mess never again do not recommend for anything the flamingo was cleaner
2264,4.0,Beautiful place to stay,Beautiful hotel! Rooms were clean and beds were really comfy. Eating places fairly expensive. Staff was very nice. Casino clean and not too smoky. The courtyard with all the flower displays was beautiful!
2265,3.0,OVER PRICE,Have been to Vegas several times and honestly was disappointed with this hotel. The bed was so unconfutable. The resort fees are higher than other casinos and they charge extra for Valet and Self Parking. Self parking was $18 per DAY. Only one exit available so be prepare to be in line for a while until you exit. Only one breakfast restaurant which lines are ridiculously long. I feel it was an average hotel nothing worth your wild. I honestly love Venetian or Palazzo way more for your money.
2266,2.0,Not good,Overpriced dirty rooms For maintenance and extremely bathroom service. There was no coffee for the coffee machine despite multiple phone calls never got the coffee. This was for a $2000 per night penthouse room. Paint chipping all over the place. Would never pay for this again.
2267,5.0,Lovely stay!,"Wish I could have stayed longer than one night. Great room, check in, check out process was a breeze and staff was wonderful. I look forward to my return on a personal basis where I can explore the amenities."
2268,5.0,"Clean, accommodating, and nice looking rooms",The staff was friendly and the room was very clean. The remodeling looked great and the air filtration system in the Stay Well room was fantastic. Also the bed was very comfortable and the remodeled shower in the Stay Well room was great looking
2269,5.0,Beautiful luxury,"Bellagio is a beautiful place to stay! It has great shops and wonderful restaurants! The fountains were gorgeous. The Cirque du Soleil show, “O” was amazing! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go because of its great location."
2270,5.0,excellent,"everything are so good for me . I have experienced a wonderful time in bellagio hotel casino and in Las Vegas overall , good foods , beautiful view , good services , specialy is very friendly. . I will be trher next time ."
2271,5.0,Luxurious accommodations with top level staff,"The rooms were fantastic and all staff no matter the pool, check-in, restaurants...all went above and beyond to help. Easily the best of any of my stays in Vegas and we had the ""least"" of the rooms available. When you stay here the resort fee actually feels like it's going towards something unlike a lot of other locales on the Strip where it feels like they're charging you for nothing."
2272,5.0,Best on the Strip,"I always wanted to stay the Blasio and finally found a good rate, it’s a top-notch property and even better if you have some status with MGM rewards. The location is outstanding it is in the best part of the strip and you can get to all the other best properties and shopping easily with a 10 or 15 minute walk."
2273,5.0,Perfect,Everything was great I won’t go to another resort after this vacation I was skeptical after winning a 5 day stay but now I will not travel to another resort ! I can’t believe how perfect a stay this was !
2274,5.0,Astonishing Hotel,"I had the most pleasant experience here. Front Dest staff are all amazing, resourceful and friendly. Housekeeping was amazing, they did our Salone Suite first every morning, and the restaurant staff at Jasmine and Yellowtail are phenomenal."
2275,1.0,Love smelling like and ashtray?,"We arrived and the valet person was friendly and nice. Checking in, the front desk clerk was nice. Beyond that, it was terrible. I booked a fountain view room, and the fountain was not working. The casino stinks like cigarettes worse than a McDonalds ashtray in the 70s. There is no ventilation in this casino. Absolutely disgusting. The machines are probably the same machines they put in when they built the place. It was scummy, the employees were rude, and half the machines did not work. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had in Vegas. The Bellagio, in my perception, was the most prestigious casino in Vegas. I was wrong. I will not be back."
2276,5.0,Great hotel - great experience,"The Bellagio is a great place to stay - center strip. I have tried a half dozen different buffets in town and none can touch the Bellagio. The customer service was outstanding. The only downside, for me, was that I needed a little more luck in the casino. This was not my first stay at the Bellagio and it won't be my last."
2277,5.0,Beautiful Rooms,Two queen beds were very comfortable. The room was spacious and very clean. Loved the glass-walled shower as well as bathtub. The twin sinks were an added bonus. Towels were thick and thirsty. My only slight concern is how far the elevators to rooms is from front desk and casino.
2278,3.0,"Nice, but problematic",We came for our honeymoon- and while nice (which you can find all over the strip) there were problems all over--. We were fraudulently charged for bottle service after we had checked out. I was able to get a full refund- but boy did I work for it. Online reviews showed that this happens alot. Another thing- even though they advertise all the MGM perks on the app that does not mean they are available to you. So while an MGM resort has a pool available you can only go to the hotel that you are booked at-- even though you are paying a resort fee for the MGM resort.
2279,5.0,Great!,Bellagio rooms are the best in Las Vegas. Other properties on the strip do not make the cut. The food was delicious. I experienced a few issues but those issues does not reflect the hotel and casino at all.
2280,5.0,Spring break,Very wonderful stay at The Bellagio. Brunch buffet was excellent and service was perfect. Pools and grounds clean and beautiful. Very refreshing. Had several visits to The Petrossian and enjoyed the cocktails and piano entertainment. Would highly recommend. Staff friendly!
2281,5.0,Vance Review,My stay at the bellAgio was a satisfying experience. I would definitely recommend your hotel to friends and family for future vacations or stays within your facility. I travel to Vegas very often and I would love to have an opportunity to have another stay at your hotel
2282,3.0,Average Accomodations.,"This did not meet expectations, while it was nice it certainly wasn't abover average. Would not book again. Bed was comfortable, but room was small, bathroom was without tub. Room service was an hour wait."
2283,1.0,worst ever,"this trip was beyond the worst ever , the room was dirty had dirty towels a mess in the sink the trash was full the handles were wet the mini bar wasn’t stocked full the bed wasn’t made , how is this acceptable and they didn’t fix the issue"
2284,5.0,Sky tower stay,"First time staying at sky tower. Overall it was great. I think the room was better than the main tower rooms. The TV was more fluid, the pillows more comfortable. We didn't have a view of the fountain this time but the view was Still great. It's a short distance walk from the garden and close to the chocolate fountain. My neighbor was very loud, tv couldn't drown the noise"
2285,5.0,Excellent weekend,"Despite this being a last minute, spare of the moment trip for my husband and I, we really enjoyed our stay. I would recommend this place in a heart beat and encourage for all to stay at this location."
2286,5.0,Great hotel and casino,"Location on the strip is near the center of the middle so you can walk to the nearby casinos easily. The hotel rooms and casino is clean, the service is top notch and “the conservatory” and “the fountains” are a must see whenever you visit Veges. As an added plus, their necessary shops carry Diet Dr. Pepper- what’s not to Love? A first rate place in my opinion."
2287,5.0,Vegas Experience,This was one of best stays in vegas. It is true you get what you pay for. The staff and cleanliness of the Bellagio is beyond what you can experience while in Vegas. The food from from room service was delicious and I would highly recommend booking dining reservations due to how quickly the book up. We also came at a perfect time to enjoy the beautiful Observatory that takes 2 weeks to come together.
2288,5.0,Best room ever,Bags was brought in the room quickly and doorman explained all the need to know information. Shopping was close.Xhexk in was fat but was a long line. Best room I have ever stayed in. Clean an security made sure only people who had room keys could enter room area.
2289,5.0,The O Show,"Cameron Conner at the ticket office went way out of his way to accommodate us and was so friendly too! He is INCREDIBLE!! The O show was fabulous and very professional, great for all ages. We had such a great night, would definitely recommend!"
2290,1.0,One of the most expensive hotels in Las Vegas and roadside motel service,I stayed 5 nights and 2 of them did not clean my room. the room guards are rude and unpleasant. parking is a mess because there is no area for hotel guests. The pool was dirty as well as the spa. Bad Hotel
2291,2.0,Bad customer service,Terrible customer service wasn't told about my room being locked because of a issue then was told I had to pay a new resort fee and put 300 down just for them to let me back in room. Completely ruined my vacation won't be staying again
2292,4.0,Bellagio Cleanliness,Rooms are amazing and very clean. Staff is very friendly. Buffet was only open until 3pm and there aren’t many cheap options for food. The fountain show out front is breathtaking. Recommend a fountain view hotel room.
2293,5.0,"Great hotel, excellent buffet, friendly staff","Overall great experience, very comfortable mattresses and bedding, excellent buffet with plenty of options and great quality food, overall happy with service, however, shower quality and water pressure is not as good as it should be for the price and rating of the hotel."
2294,3.0,Little annoying details - Nickel and dimed,"Alot of details missing at Bellagio - linking parking charges to room key or phone, check-in circus to find an agent, lack of fridge disclosures, hope you don't use or limited rewards, and that annoying resort fee - even though rooms are ""comped"" they nickel and dime you to death...."
2295,5.0,Good services,Very good maintenance and outstanding customer services. I really enjoyed the Bellagio and will recommend it to anyone. I’m Very pleased with my stays. Housekeeping was also amazing. Concierge outstanding and bags services also great.
2296,5.0,Fountains galore,People told me that a room with a view of the fountain was going to be excess and not needed were they wrong! My wife and I sat and watch the fountains almost every time it came on it is such a different angle on something so beautiful! Definitely would recommend!
2297,4.0,Great,Great all around experience looking forward to coming back to visit. The staff was top notch and very friendly. I liked the safety aspect of the elevator room card scanning. We will definitely be back to visit.
2298,5.0,A Fun Dealer,"Liz Argel was our dealer at three card poker, my wife and I were new to the game as we usually just play black jack. Liz made us both feel very comfortable as she continued to teach us the game, once we got the hang of it Liz continued to interact with us, not just doing her job to deal the cards but making the table a fun place to be, we looked for her the next night but no luck! Liz thanks for making our three card poker intro a fun one!!"
2299,5.0,Bellagio visit 3/14-18/2022,"A beautiful, bustling hotel with all of the amenities needed for fun and relaxation. We visited many excellent restaurants this year including Spago’s. It is also centrally located on the strip so many other mgm properties are close by to visit and enjoy. We use the tram to aria and pat mgm daily!"
2300,4.0,Bellagio was a great experience. I liked the train which took us to Eataly.,"The train took us from Bellagio to the mgm park hotel, which was Eataly. I felt safe and enjoyed the piano bar and I enjoyed playing some of the slots. I also enjoyed spur of the moment eating at ""noodle"". Coffee/gelato shop was very good."
2301,5.0,Laura Torres,"This is our 2nd stay at the Bellagio. Our room attendant was amazing. Great personality, friendly and very attentive to our needs. We can thank her enough for making us feel welcome. Thank you Jason Brown"
2302,4.0,Great Stay,"This iconic hotel was worth price. We were fortunate to see the Bellagio 's conversatory transform to the spring display during our stay. OF course, the hotel could use some updates but it's centrally located and beautiful"
2303,3.0,"Fantastic Facilities, but basic player rewards recognitions","We had a decent stay. As far as properties, you can't beat Bellagio. however we had a couple negatives that weren't resolved very quickly, and were the staff never followed up to ensure our stay was world class. The rooms were nice, clean, and had great views. Our neighbors were unfortunately extremely rowdy, and lacked common courtesy. They were having a party and slamming doors from 2-5 each morning, and then the second night locked themselves out for about an hour, and just continued to party in the hallway. The staff came to let them in around 4:45AM after about an hour of them yelling in the hallway, and bumping into our door. I only mentioned this because the staff came up and saw what was going on, but no one checked in on us. Would be nice to have someone check to see"
2304,5.0,best of las vegas,"best location all the amenities best restaurants . super super clean great pool area great staff very friendly acces to meny differents atraccion inside and out side the hotel circus du soleil ""O"" grat room in dining"
2305,5.0,Bellagio deserves all the good things you hear about it...beyond the fountains and Cirque de Soleil,"Yes, there's a lot of terrific and classy places to stay and have fun in Vegas but Bellagio always has to be in the conversation. Can't beat the location and there are enough options for food, drink and fun to keep anybody happy. The service people are top notch"
2306,5.0,Fabulous Hotel,"We had 5 days at this wonderful hotel The staff are so helpful and very friendly Its my first time to Vegas and I was blown away by the hotel the room was amazing and the food the same Very clean everywhere you go , the restaurants where all just amazing I would highly recommend this hotel. Only thing I missed was tea and coffee maker my room Very happy customer"
2307,4.0,"It was ok…,.",For the price the room should be furnished nicer…..we had a fountain view room which was nice. I did love the pool area and being able to go to a show without leaving the hotel. Hotels should be smoke free now!!!!!
2308,5.0,Always a Good Time,"Came to celebrate acceptance into medical school and March Madness. The property is always well kept and my personal favorite. The conservatory is the definition of impeccable and so visually satisfying. The fountains are always a repeated must see landmark and spectacle. The casino service is top notch, making it my favorite place to play. The hotel rooms are both modern and elegantly themed to Bellagio. I always have a good time at Bellagio."
2309,5.0,Luxury at it's best,"It is simply the best experience. Must visit at least once. Friendly stuff, clean property, luxury all around. Shops, shows and restaurants are all best and must try. Great location as well, since you are right in the middle of Las Vegas."
2310,5.0,March Madness,"Great stay at the Bellagio. Place was packed! Rooms are very comfortable, staff is wonderful and courteous. Recommend getting a room facing the Fountain Show, which is a must! Hotel could use some more casual dining options. Also, the cirque de Soleil house show needs less time with the clowns, which are pretty boring."
2311,5.0,BLV,The hotel is clean and efficient. The lobby was beautiful I wish no smoking in casino. The front desk were amazing. The bell hops too. Room service was fast and my order was perfect. I would stay again.
2312,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,"When you live in Hawaii, staying at a hotel for under $200.00 is a steal! You can find reasonable rates for this hotel online. How can you not stay at this beautiful Hotel! The location is central, you can walk or catch the tram to eateries and shopping."
2313,1.0,Too Big for their own good,"There are a lot of choices on the strip. No reason to stay here. Too many people, staff unable to accommodate properly and just not what it used to be. I love utilizing the spa facilities at hotels and I could not access it here unless I bought a treatment, even though I was willing to pay the daily rate. Oh well, last time here."
2314,5.0,Vegas trip,Thank you for the room this was a great vacation we are Looking forward to returning asap. We also look forward to visiting more Mlife facilities when return . Our family had a great experience on this trip. Thank you John DeLuca
2315,3.0,You can do better,"If you are staying at the Bellagio, if you are like me, it’s because you were looking forward to staying someplace great. Let me start off by staying we stayed in one of the stay well room. Having a HEPA filter during a pandemic was definitely a plus. The beds are super comfortable and the room itself was great. If I would have stayed in the room only I would have loved it. However, the second you get on the elevators the cigarette smoke is unbelievable in this day and age. Everyone in our party got headaches from the smoke. It’s so bad we stopped enjoying the casino or hotel at all and went to the park MGM where it’s non smoking and will stay there moving forward. Staff was underwhelming as was the spa, however the massage therapists were incredible and a true asset. Hopefully"
2316,2.0,Sour end to girls trip when we were catcalled multiple times at the Bellagio,"We ended our multiple week road-trip in Vegas and decided to stay at the Bellagio. While the room and service were exceptional, every single time me and my friends exited the room and walked through the lobby area/casino, we were subject to lewd comments by men. We had a Suite and paid an insane amount of money to stay at the hotel only to feel dehumanized and uncomfortable everytime we left the room. One of the comments were “love your top, can I take it off” to my friend dressed pretty modestly in broad daylight and nobody from the Bellagio did anything to stop this behavior despite our reports to the front desk/casino managers."
2317,5.0,Bellagio is amazing,Bellagio is the best and recommend to everyone to stay here. Staff was super friendly. Food was delicious. Slots paid out well. Hit lots of hands pay’s and got paid fast. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Also sports betting with MGM bets is super easy and amazing!!!
2318,5.0,Pricey!,"The king premier room was large with a large television, but no coffee in the room and only two low nightstands for clothing storage (plus closet), no dresser. We came for our daughter’s wedding, held at the Bellagio, so expected high prices, but the room fell somewhat short of our expectations."
2319,5.0,We Never Stay Anywhere Else!,"We always stay at the Bellagio on our trips to Vegas. The staff is exceptional, helpful and friendly. If we ever encounter a problem (which is rarely) a staff member is always there to help. Food choices are excellent, even room service food quality is five-star. Rooms are comfortable and clean and upgrades are available to Rewards Members. Slots are fun and pay pretty good giving one a chance to have fun for many hours on the casino floor."
2320,5.0,Excellent stay in Bellagio,It was my first time staying inBellagio and I would definitely go back. The room is very clean and quiet where you can rest well.The staff is very friendly and helpful .I’m very satisfied with their service plus give me a good discount.
2321,5.0,VIP Services,"Lisset from VIP Services was wonderful as she checked us in to the Bellagio. All the staff there are so wonderful. My Host, Anne Marie, is fabulous and always takes such great care of me and my party. As always the Bellagio was beautiful and the garden was outstanding this year! I always stay here and thought I might consider another Hotel for a change of pace but I can’t give up the luxury and outstanding customer service of the Bellagio. It’s such a nice spot on the strip, restaurants are great but I wish they did not allow smoking. Apparently the only hotel on the strip that is non-smoking is Park MGM. And then there are the Iconic Fountains….do not miss!"
2322,3.0,"Beautiful Hotel, crummy room","We got a promotion for a free room. The hotel it's self is quite beautiful. The room, not so much. Frayed carpets, cheap robes, you wouldn't even want to touch, less put on. The light for the mirror make up was out. No fan in the bathroom, so if anyone makes a sticky it lingers for hours. Food is ridiculously expensive. We had a random worker pop his head into our room, was not check out day or anything, he's just walking in and out of rooms on our floor! No coffee pot in room. There are just better places to stay if you head to Vegas than here."
2323,5.0,Great Stay at Bellagio to celebrate birthday,"First trip to Las Vegas and Bellagio did not disappoint. What a fabulous hotel. it's everything people say about it. Room was upgraded, and we were made to feel special while celebrating my wife's birthday. Will go back again."
2324,5.0,Top notch,Beautiful hotel in the middle of the action. Loved the view of the fountains and the strip. Food was delicious and service was outstanding. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Las Vegas.
2325,3.0,Bellagio smelled like an ashtray,We were surprised that the supposed upscale Bellagio allowed smoking. It reeked of cigar and cigarette smoke throughout the hotel. MGM Park was way better. If we ever return to Las Vegas we will stay there.
2326,1.0,Horrible casino hostesses,Unless your at the tables the hostess doesn’t acknowledge or offer u any kind of service. We had one walk past us multiple times and us ask directly to place an order and she ignored us for no apparent reason.
2327,3.0,Okay,Nice hotel but rooms feel dated and the bathroom shower leaked out into bathroom floor. Check in was delayed past regular 3p checkin time even though we arrived by 9am and registered onsite. Bag check was very friendly so we were at least freed up to go see the sights.
2328,3.0,march stay,"not the usual impeccable, detail attentive Bellagio stay. Room was missing towels, amenities etc. NOT CLEANED WELL ON OTHER DAYS. Also while gambling for several hours, we were never offered a drink and when requested, waitress was rude and dismissive."
2329,3.0,"Just Ok, Not as Expected","Went for our anniversary and have not stayed at the Bellagio in prior trips to Vegas. We wanted to elevate it this time but found the Bellagio to have very fancy prices but not the atmosphere to match. Customer service was almost non existent, very disappointing. We paid $60 for late check out and the maid started banging on our door, trying to enter and yelling at us at 10:30am. Had to call guest services to get her to stop. No credit or apology was offered. Just disappointing after having high expectations. The casino is clean and has lots of different slots."
2330,5.0,Exceptional,"My conference was at Rio where I booked a room. I got in from NJ AT 9 pm - it was a nightmare there - immediately cancelled and booked at Bellagio. It was like leaving hell and walking into heaven. Available people at beautiful front desk, spectacular architectural design, smoky casino off to side, excellent security at room elevators, room key access only to floors, - the room- I have never been in a hotel room so aesthetically pleasing. It was perfect."
2331,5.0,Getting Away from Kids,A beautiful and relaxing trip to the Bellagio to get a break from parenting. The fountain view was perfect from the 22nd floor and we enjoyed every minute. Was surprised all gelato options were closed at 8pm but live and learn.
2332,5.0,3rd Trip,3 trips within 6 months. Each one better then the last. Bellagio is alsome! Flower garden is a must see. Staff members always have a smile. Rooms are nice. Mine had a safe and a huge bathtub. Loved it.
2333,4.0,Satisfied,"We love our stay at the hotel. Everything from room to service was great. The only problem we had was how expensive it was, but thst seemed to be Vegas on a whole. There is a $600 security deposit which went fast. It included resort fees and minibar. A $10.00 water was a bit much. But, all and all it was great. My husband and enjoyed our Anniversary trip. We will definitely be back and stay at the Bellagio again."
2334,5.0,Bellagio where Dreams come True,"Bellagio is not best in class. It’s in its own. Steve Wynn has done an amazing job of not only creating what it means to be in Las Vegas but what is possible when you dream. Center strip, iconic views, staff that know what it means to give great service and best of all at the Bellagio you will always leave wanting to come back."
2335,3.0,"Hall of Room Services Dishes, Awful Water Pressure & Nonexistent WiFi","The stay was pretty underwhelming and disappointing. It was the first time I have stayed at Bellagio after visiting Vegas maybe 50+ times in my life. I have stayed at all of the big strip resorts, but never Bellagio. When we checked in at 2pm there was someone else's room service directly outside our room. It was an half eaten cheese plate or something like that. I called down to guest services and asked if someone could come pick it up. They apologized and said that would get someone to come handle it. We went to lunch and returned around 5pm. The dishes were still outside our room. I called down to guest services again and was told the same thing. When we left for dinner an hour later they were still there. When we got back from Guy Savoy (amazing food by the way) at 9-9:30pm"
2336,4.0,Pool charges,"I booked a 4 night stay for my family. I wanted to celebrate my husbands good health, since last year he wasn’t so lucky. To make it special I book the world famous Bellagio. I spent a lot of money for this hotel and frankly it wasn’t worth it. The room isn’t as clean as a lux hotel should be. The AC would stop a lot and there were times we were removing clothes. A fridge full of their staff but no room to put my own. 1 coffee and 2 juices was like $40 every morning because no other place was open. We were taking a nap in the middle of the one day because we were going to the supper club and staying out late. We get woken up with a call from the pool asking my partner if he was ready to close his cabana bill. Cabana bill? We were at the pool for two ours 4 drinks, paid on his"
2337,5.0,Wonderful residence in Belagio.,Wonderful experience at this hotel. Friendly and professional staff. Perfect breakfast at Saddel restaurant. Swimming pools were super clean. Other amenities were also good. Car rental was so helpful because all other companies were all sold out.
2338,1.0,Horrible,"The hosts are not friendly and rude, be careful if you loose to much money they are not covering anything, don’t charge to your room any stuff they will not cover at the end of your trip as promised, don’t stay here"
2339,5.0,Bellagio LV,"Great place to stay in LV. Location, restaurant choices, excellent staff, services. Close to all activities and shows, spectacular pool, choices of slot machines and other gambling option. Would look to stay at this property again"
2340,5.0,"Great Property, Food & Entertainment","Everything was great, except for a few issues concerning our room. Taking off 2-3 points because our room smelled horrible. Smelled like sulfur/rotten eggs in the bathroom, the smell was coming out of toilet and sinks. We knew it had to be an issue because at the bridge areas to the hotel also smelled the exact same way. We asked about it, but got no remedy. Secondly, we arrived on time for check in with the app, after an hour later, still nothing. Front desk lady, simply told us that we had to still wait and there was nothing she could do. We asked another front desk employee the same question and as soon as I presented my Military I.D, they apologized and put us in a different room (unfortunately this was the stinky room). So we tried to spend every waking moment of our 1 week"
2341,5.0,Nice hotel,"Always get the same treatment, vip services we’re excellent I would highly recommend this hotel and casino as I have been coming here for the last 15 years. Great pool, casino is awesome and right on the strip Thank You"
2342,3.0,not good as expected,The towel was not clean and had dirty dots on it and also the deposit fees was too high without reasons and I wanna figure out this problems. And also the check in speed is slow but the waiter is friendly so that we could accept
2343,3.0,Money Grab,"The hotel is nice, the staff was great, but everything about my experience was that they were trying to extract every last penny from you. A bottle of water in your room $12, a can of coke $10. Not one single restaurant with reasonable pricing. And I travel a lot. But 30 to 50% higher just because you are at the Bellagio is just not right"
2344,5.0,The best of the MGM Properties,"The Bellagio is the crème del-a crème of properties. You have the world famous fountains as you approach the entrance and as you come into the lobby, the conservatory is stunningly gorgeous. The rooms are elegant despite the age of the hotel, and the attention to detail is not lost. The casino is always bustling and the Sportsbook is gigantic area of tables and a historic bar. The signature restaurants within the property are amazing! I recommend PRIME Steakhouse for a meal you’ll never forget. You can find a variety of cuisines from Steak, Seafood, Chinese, Japanese, French Pastries etc…"
2345,5.0,Busy Atmosphere. Loud rooms.,"Very loud rooms next to us made it hard to sleep at night, it was a conjoining room that we didn't have choice in. Was here on a business trip so sleep was definitely key for me. Good location right on strip. Fun casino life, higher end $$$ tables to play. Staff everywhere for questions and help getting somewhere, some with smiles others you can tell it was just a job."
2346,3.0,"Nice hotel, average experience","If you pay $500 for a night in Vegas, I feel the experience must be absolutely outstanding and I don't think it was. Check in wasn't very nice, yes we used the wrong line but being reprimanded what we've done wrong was annoying. Also, the property doesn't have a pub. The breakfast buffet was completely overpriced at $60 a person."
2347,5.0,"Excellent, upscale hotel","Excellent service, clean, friendly, and accommodating! The casino was nicely done. Stores were so very nice! The staff was knowledgeable. We absolutely loved the flower area! The hot air balloons made of flowers were stunning!!"
2348,5.0,"Excellent, upscale hotel","Excellent service, clean, friendly, and accommodating! The casino was nicely done. Stores were so very nice! The staff was knowledgeable. We absolutely loved the flower area! The hot air balloons made of flowers were stunning!!"
2349,5.0,The best casino on the strip,We stayed here for the fist time and it is much better then all of the other places that we have stayed. Very clean casino and rooms. The employees were very friendly and professional. The casino has a wide variety of games and also plenty of different food options. We will definitely stay here when we travel to Vegas again.
2350,5.0,Best hotel in Vegas.,"Destination site for tourist JUST to see the fountain. Inside, the botanical garden, the Chihuly exhibit, and the fitness center are all world class. Used the bathtub in the room every day - big enough for two (though we're both rather small - perfect for us!). Found food for a range of experiences (quick grab and go; formal dining; evening sweets)."
2351,2.0,Not what you expect,"The room was big but it wasn't cleaned properly. We found a pill by the night stand. The door stopper was busted. The view was bad and the price excessive. The pools close at 5pm! And they charge a resort fee that is not justified at all. The smoke is everywhere. I have asthma and there is no other way out of the hotel but through the smoky casino. The check in process was long and painful, the woman who checked me in was rude, and dismissive. I will never go back. I felt unseen and one more of the crowd. This was disappointing and unnecessarily expensive for people like me who just wanted to see Vegas. They only care about big gamblers. I noticed that from the first day."
2352,5.0,Great time at Bellagio,"Comfortable beds, friendly staff, clean resort with a variety of slot machines. Although the tables had a high minimum we were able to get on roulette, craps and Blackjack on the computerized games for a 5.00 min"
2353,5.0,Great Stay,"The Bellagio is a fantastic place to stay and we certainly enjoyed our stay. There are restaurants and facilities for all in the family to enjoy. Without a doubt, this is the place to stay in Las Vegas. Customer service is superb and nobody could be disappointed with a room booked here."
2354,5.0,Amazing stay,"Everything was stunning, but a lot of the hotel smelled like cigarettes. The only places that didn’t smell were the rooms and the conservatory. If you get over the smell, it’s honestly a really nice place to stay!"
2355,1.0,The Luxury Service is Gone,"Be prepared…three consecutive days at 6:30 am there was a 20 minute hold for room service followed by an hour delivery time. Don’t get hopeful that other guest services will be better. Is it labor shortage or is it management. Our experience was management skills on guest handling is gone. Marsha the Operations Dir for Housekeeping was the best example. We had a housekeeper in our suite at 10 pm, asked her to leave and by the next day her story was we were drunk and mean to her - - but not a question from Marsha - just accusations and threats. For $2K per night a guest should be listened to and a leader should think about all positions. Nothing felt like the Bellagio of Feb of 2020 or before."
2356,5.0,Elegant stay,Bellagio is a beautiful hotel. Every part of it is clean and well maintained. The flowers are beautiful! We enjoyed the location since it is somewhat in the middle of the strip. Our rooms were stylish and modern.
2357,5.0,Booking my next stay!,"Fantastic service, immaculate room, and an all around great experience. Every time we go to Vegas I feel the need to get out and about, we still did but the Bellagio is the first resort that left me wanting to stay there all day and night!"
2358,1.0,Overrated,"Just a underwhelming experience. Room had a cigarette burn in the ottoman, no trash can in the bed area, only bathroom. No coffee maker in room, no microwave or fridge other than minibar. Front desk staff didn’t know pool hours. No price list on minibar and no help from staff to meet you anywhere on the outrageous charges. 1 bottle of water was $22. So don’t wake up in the middle of the night choking and think you can have a drink. Won’t be staying there or recommending this hotel to anyone."
2359,2.0,Overpriced!!,"Overpriced vending machine in room masquerading as a refrigerator! I hope you do not intend to use the refrigerator in your room, because you cannot! No coffee maker in rooms either! I had to walk close to 100 yards to my room from the closest elevator. The pools closed at 5 pm in the city that never sleeps! Do your self a favor and stay somewhere else, more reasonable priced with some character to the structure, the Bellagio was Boring!"
2360,3.0,Legacy stay with overpriced pseudo- luxury accommodations,"Bellagio used to be synonymous with upscale and luxury. It is more than a little dated - upgrading to VIP 2 bedroom fountain view suite yielded no additional service. Private check in was a joke as there was a long line in that queue as well and the staff was rude and dismissive. The airport pick up and return was a nice perk - and the drivers were polite and efficient. Tried to order flowers and macarons to be in the room upon check in, they were not delivered and had to be requested again. Roll away was delivered after multiple calls - and simply disappointed as the purpose in spending over $2000/night was to have a more catered and luxury experience."
2361,5.0,Excellent,Service was excellent very accommodating and friendly staff penthouse fountain view room was great location is excellent and easy to get around would recommend and definitely be staying again next... .
2362,1.0,Disappointing experience,"The room was hot, air didn’t function. shower had no water pressure, and the hotel was over-crowded. The bed was not what the reviews claim it to be. We received charges on our room that weren’t ours, and still have unresolved charges. Over all- we wouldn’t stay here again."
2363,4.0,Beautiful hotel and spacious suites but customer service is lacking.,"Beautiful hotel, spacious suites and nice views but the customer service (or lack there of) could use some serious improvement. And the check in process, including the advance check in, is worse than abysmal!"
2364,3.0,"I really expect more from a ""luxury"" property.","I know the Bellagio wants to attract people from outside the hotel to their casino, shops, and restaurants, but when it becomes so crowded that those of us staying in the hotel are impacted it's just too much. First the highlights of our trip: the beds are super comfy, and in-room dining is both a great value, and the staff are great. The Cypress pool staff and experience are great. Though, it is too easy for others who are not supposed to be in the area to come through and loiter. The restaurants are great! In general the staff is really great, and they know the property well. There were some accessibility issues. Most of the escalators in and around the property were not working. My mom is 70 and has some mobility issues. The main entrance of the pool has no elevator, and"
2365,1.0,Terrible customer service,Terrible and racist staff. Didn’t greet me I stayed in VIP the staff helped other customers of other race didn’t say anything to me like I didn’t exist. I will never stay at this location again ever. K
2366,3.0,My stay,I the staff was not very friendly. They need to realize that not everyone is a platinum member. If your not then yout get treated differently. It is sad. I spent alot of money there to be treated less than because of there tier rating..lol it is a joke...
2367,4.0,No coffee in the rooms,"Just a heads up! There is no coffee/tea setup in the rooms, and you can't request a coffee maker for the room. No microwave to heat up water either. Room service coffee is $22+tip. The Palio coffee shop opens at 6 a.m. (I've been told it's a Vegas thing, and this is definitely true of other hotels like the Wynn, etc.)"
2368,4.0,Fantastic Penthouse Suite,"We stayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom penthouse suite and had a wonderful visit. The room was clean and well appointed and the vip service we received was top notch. The only negative was the quality of the room service food at dinner and breakfast. The fountain view was spectacular and everyone from the bellman, concierge, and cleaning staff were terrific."
2369,5.0,NADA 2022,"I have been to Vegas several times, but I have never stayed at the Bellagio. I was a friendly, clean place to stay. It is very easy to get in and out of and is also centralized. Walking distance to everything on the strip. The fountains were incredible as always! Thanks Bellagio!"
2370,4.0,The atmosphere was elegant and entertaining.,"We selected to stay at Bellagio because of its convenient location and its variety of eateries, from casual to elegant. We were not disappointed. On the minus side, it is so large that it requires considerable amount of walking. My only complaint is that the shower needed a non-slip mat."
2371,5.0,The best hotel in Vegas,"We have been coming here since they opened. We have tried other hotels, but always return to Bellagio! Thank you, thank you, thank you for making our vacation so memorable! We will return again, soon I hope!"
2372,5.0,MUST STAY!,"Absolutely perfect! Everyone was great and made our trip extra special. The food was on point no matter where you went. The star of the weekend was LAGO. However, HARVEST was so good and the service was outstanding!"
2373,4.0,Costly 4 Days!!,Had a great time. Played slots $1-$3 bets.Total around $2500.00 Largest win $180 BLAH!! Never heard anyone hit a jackpot!! Room were great with great service. Buffet was not that great. Best part was Omelet Station. Hours of operation (closes at 3PM) sucked.
2374,5.0,Bellagio is the best,"I have been to Vegas many times and my favorite place to stay is the Bellagio. The staff, the rooms, the decorations, restaurants and clubs are second to none. I recommend the Bellagio to all my family and friends"
2375,5.0,Loved The Bellagio!,"Great ambiance, more than a casino feel, excellent spa, bright and airy, gorgeous decor in the lobby in particular, lovely rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location on The Strip. Stayed for 5 days. Highly recommend The Bellagio!"
2376,5.0,Vegas Trip,"Excellent experience from the time I checked in to check out. Professional staff, clean rooms, beautiful restaurants. Bellagio is my favorite hotel because I am never disappointed in the top level of customer care and top rated services from the entire staff."
2377,5.0,Elegant stay,Excellent center strip location. Loved the sense of calm I felt every time I left the busy strip and entered the Bellagio. Conservatory is beautiful. Get a fountain view room. Loved piano player in bar by lobby
2378,5.0,Bellagio Las Vegas Spa Tower,The room was extremely clean and bed comfortable. We enjoyed the oversized bathroom and soaking tub. It was nice and relaxing after a day of walking. Highly recommend Bellagio for your next stay in Vegas.
2379,5.0,Bellagio As Good As Expected,The service was great. The amenities were outstanding. Perfect location right in the middle of everything. The fountains were gorgeous and entertaining. The restaurants were delicious and easy to get reservations.
2380,4.0,3 Night Stay,Quick check in and out with app and new kiosks. Bellagio has refurbished hallway and room since last visit. Need better mix of slots and table minimums. Need different restaurant mix for more casual meals.
2381,4.0,Good but not Great,"MGM rewards is confusing and you have to know to get your card right when you check in otherwise you will lose on points and perks. Despite requesting daily house keeping, they skipped day two and we came back to a dirty room. Fountain view room on the 17th floor was nice, but was not aware that one would hear fountain blasts late into the night."
2382,5.0,World class Resort.,Bellagio is a world class facility. I especially like that it is centrally located on the strip. Easy to walk to other properties and restaurants. The casino and craps tables are the best in Las vegas. Beautiful pool. Great and diverse dining choices.
2383,5.0,Exceptional services!,From front desk to in room dining services to amenities Bellagio is exceptional and complete. Definitely sets the bar high! I’m looking forward to stay at this hotel again. My friends and I enjoyed every minute of our stay.
2384,5.0,"As fresh, confident and beautiful as my first trip there in 1999…","From the moment I arrived on property the beauty was awe inspiring. Although I’ve stayed here several times since my first visit in 1999, just months after it’s opening, I just kept thinking that the property looks exactly as it did then… fresh, vibrant and wonderful. And the team were extremely friendly and very efficient in all aspects and executions. Special shout out to the Butler Team who helped us on the 33rd floor. But, maids, bell team, food services, all wonderful. Place rocks!"
2385,4.0,What a view,"The staff were amazing. The room in the spa tower was great, with a brilliant view. The pool was great, although difficult to get a drink. The location was perfect. The concierge was very helpful. Housekeeping didn’t clean our room on a couple of days, even though we were out of the room most of the day and evening. The laundry service promised an 8hr turn around, which took nearly 36hrs. I expected perfection… I might try a different hotel next time."
2386,5.0,Creme de la creme,"Just all around the best service, aesthetics, and leisure. And the gelato is everything. Very luxurious stay. The bathtub is huge and comfy bathrobes are provided. I travel a lot but I was truly blown away by the beauty of this hotel."
2387,5.0,Excellent room service. Beautiful hotel must be the best,The Hotel Bellagio is magnificent beautiful hotel in the middle of everything. The bell staff I gave my luggage to was very friendly and polite. The front desk agent from Veracruz was very friendly. The housekeeping attendant kept the room super organized and clean!!!
2388,5.0,Best stay ever!,"If you're looking for a beautiful place at a reasonable rate with stellar service, this is the place to stay at! Every team/dept we had an encounter with, we're professional and friendly! We can't wait to go back to the Bellagio!"
2389,5.0,Perfection,Beautiful hotel with fantastic views of the gorgeous fountains its famous for! The Cirque du Soleil “O” show was AMAZING! The Bellagio’s location is perfect on the strip. I will gladly stay here again!
2390,5.0,Always top notch,"The hotel is beautiful. Everyone was super friendly. My only request is to have the room made up everyday. There were a few days missed, but other than that it was a great place to stay. I would highly recommend to anyone."
2391,4.0,Friendly but doesn't sleep well,The staff was very friendly. From the lady that checked us in to the ladies that cleaned our room. Pillows did not have much to them and the drink servers didn't seem to want to bring drinks. Great views from rooms
2392,5.0,Great place on the strip!!!!,"If you need a clean place on the strip, come here! Great food, great customer service, great security. Bring your family, friends, and kids here! Love all the amenities too! The drinks were also great!"
2393,5.0,Spoiling made easy,"Celebration of a birthday is made easy by the staff at Bellagio. Everyone and everything was perfect! We enjoyed every moment from checking in, lunches, dinners and shows. We look forward to the next celebration!"
2394,5.0,Stay was bussin',"Great hotel, really. Friendly and helpful staff, tons of shopping and food, whole ass tv in the bathroom mirror, amazing view of the fountains from our room, soft robes, comfy bed. Bellagio was a great place to stay. Stay bussin' Bellagio"
2395,1.0,"Come on Bellagio, you can do better!",Stayed here more than a dozen times over the years. Experience is usually good. This one was not: Room was acceptable. Check-in and check out were unacceptable. Food was mediocre at best and overpriced for quality. Had to switch client meal reservations to other venues.
2396,5.0,Our anniversary trip,"My husband and I took a trip to honor our 35 years together. The Bellagio was a great place to stay. When we wanted to rest, it was a super quiet hotel. When we wanted to party, we found that too! It was a great location and the staff was amazing!"
2397,5.0,Always a great stay,"We love the belliago, it is our preferred choice in Vegas. The staff is always friendly and helpful . The decor changes so much that it’s a delight to see the new creative idea they have in the butterfly garden. The food is great you can’t go wrong with this location"
2398,4.0,We’ll be back to stay,This was our first time staying on the strip and I’m glad we stayed at the Bellagio. We’d definitely be back. We were there to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday and it was worth every penny. The couples massage and the eucalyptus steam was a highlight. We also loved floor 24 with all the special perks.
2399,5.0,If you like detail and great service your search stops here!,From check in to concierge and ambiance of fresh flowers to the detail of the art alone in this establishment you’ll definitely be astonished by this facility in its architecture and friendly service from its team members eager to meet your needs. I absolutely enjoyed my stay and will book for a longer period next time!
2400,2.0,Room wasn't ready!,"Booked a suite, the room wasn't ready when i went to check in at 315, 3 is check in time. Didn't get my room assigned until almost 630, over 3 hrs later! Compensation was $100 good credit and free parking... this room cost $1k, check in at 3, check out at 11, that means this room is $50/hr! Compensation was not adequate."
2401,5.0,Great Getaway,"Awesome trip, Bellagio Resorts and Casino is the best, great service, value and beautiful rooms.Cleaning staff did a great job, cleaning after I left the room, the staff even bought ice to my room when the ice machine went down. Food is great, overall I had a great vacation."
2402,5.0,Great time,"Staff was exceptional, greeted with good morning every morning and very helpful . Room was great , clean and great views . Casino was clean and staff were great . Will most definitely stay there again . Thank you Bellagio 😎"
2403,5.0,Great Time,Great time and the staff was over the top in courtesy. Always greeting and making us feel welcomed at all times. We will be back again you can count on that. Wish they had more choices to eat at because the prices were reasonable.
2404,3.0,Wouldn’t stay again.,"The casino was disgustingly smoky, we all immediately had very sore throats that didn’t go away until we left the hotel. The maid service was not great, we called to have them clean while we were gone for over 3 hours but no one ever came. Room service took an 1hr 30mins & wasn’t very good. Bass from the night clubs was unbearably loud, woke us up every night even though we were on a high floor. Only good thing was dinner at Michael Mina. Definitely won’t be staying there again."
2405,5.0,Bellagio NADA Conference,My first time staying here. Everyone was pleasant and accommodating. Beds were comfortable and room was clean. Housekeeping staff are among the best in the business. I would highly recommend staying in a room above the 5th floor otherwise you can smell the smoke from the casino according to a fellow coworker.
2406,3.0,Not what it used to be,"Bellagio used to be synonymous with luxury and high-end; that is no longer the case. The entire hotel is overcrowded and the rooms are rundown and in dire need of remodeling. Our room had an A/C unit that barely blew, but rattled so loud it woke me from my sleep several times. Our shower head had barely a drip (no pressure), and there was an entire smashed cookie on the floor, and crumbs all over the room. We will not be staying here again."
2407,5.0,Great Gaming Hosts,"If you like Blackjack with a twist and you want knowledgeable dealers, go see Sonny Tran and Ruby Santos at the Free Bet Blackjack table! They were awesome and kept the table light and moving. They were patient with those that needed to learn the game and were willing to answer any questions. First rate job!"
2408,5.0,Overall a great experience,"Overall a great experience. I am very comfortable recommending the Bellagio to anyone coming to Vegas. Check in was quick and seamless. Breakfast buffet was pricey, but very good. Location is central to other amenities."
2409,5.0,Feel like queen!,"The location is unbeatable. Great environment, easy check in/check out, great gym, spacious rooms, fantastic casino, top notch restaurants, perfect location! Had to ask for house keeping services. limited in room dining menu. Wish there was another on-the-go/quick bites place on property."
2410,5.0,Bellagio always hits on all cylinders!,Bellagio is always a wonderful time. Accomodations are perfect and service is above expectations. Reem Mikael my host is someone you can lean on. Can't imagine staying anywhere else with all the changes in Vegas these days!
2411,1.0,Never again,"Check your bill, as we were overcharged We we’re overcharged $400 - check you bill. From Wednesday to Saturday our room was made up zero times. We anticipated a quieter hotel, given the expense, but drunk, noisy neighbors at 4:30 am woke us up. Limited fitness center hours (7am - 6pm). Disappointed - - won’t book here again."
2412,3.0,Would go back to the Mirage,"We stayed at the Bellagio for three nights. On our first night we walked to the window to watch the fountains only to have our socks get soaking wet by something in the carpet. I called the front desk and they gave us a $50 food credit towards the hotel. Then one of our sinks was backed up and then our shower backed up and we were in standing water while showering. They sent a maintenance person to fix it while we were away but after one shower the problem came back. They offered to deduct the resort fees from our bill. Would have liked to have seen more. The windows were dirty, you have to walk a great distance from check in to just get over to the hotel elevators and then we had to walk what seemed like a half a mile down the hall to our room which was on the end. We also felt"
2413,4.0,Nice Place to stay,"Not as much walk through traffic as other casinos. Less smoke in game area. Nice pools. Modern rooms. Great location on strip. However, there are not enough reasonably priced restaurants, and few vegetarian options."
2414,5.0,Great place,Had a great vacation! Casino had plenty of machines to play on. Staff was great and friendly. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to Vegas.
2415,4.0,"Nice Place, but something was missing.","The Bellagio is an awesome place to stay. It has excellent amenities and word class service. However there was an item or 2 in connection with the hotel layout as you access the spa, gym or pool area requires a considerable walk through the hotel. Also only 1 Starbucks on the property and it is not conveniently located."
2416,2.0,"bellagio deteriorating,","cleanlioness is a big problem. morale of staff if poor. when asked tjhey show that they are disatistifed in the way that they are treatd by their employer. spa is a joke in that the drains in the showers do nto work and one stands in two inches dirty water when trying to shower and clean up. room dusty, toilet never cleaned all week, had to beg for housekeeping to come, never the right amount of towels, noisy, creepy people somehow getting past serurity and onto the guest floors. scary for females."
2417,5.0,Good stay.,"Overall we had a nice stay. There were a few small issues with billing and housekeeping delays, that were corrected. The hotel was extremely crowded on the weekend. If I were to go back, I would travel during the week."
2418,5.0,"Thomas Ferraro, legend","Mr. Ferraro is a great ambassador for the Bellagio, and he made our trip memorable. People like him make this my favorite place I'm Vegas. Whatever he's doing he should keep it up. Josephine and Thomas are about to celebrate 30 years."
2419,1.0,Terrible service,"Had terrible service. Room was freezing at night. Tv didn’t work. Room service food was cold. Using the app and phone on the elevator was a pain in the butt. Had to make several attempts just to hit my floor button. Casino employee, walking by my blackjack table stopped, and unsolicited, tried to tell me what “hits” to make with my cards! Total jerk!"
2420,3.0,Davis review of Bellagio,"Nice venue but felt nickel and dimed. Felt like we were more of a dollar sign than a guest. Rooms were nice, no fridge, no microwave. It would cost for a fridge etc. The housekeeping staff were amazing though."
2421,5.0,Great view and stay,"We visit the Bellagio hotel once or twice a year and this is the first stay in 2022. Because of my Hyatt royalty membership status, We receive free parking and valet service. etc. As always spectacular view of the fountain show. We love this hotel."
2422,5.0,Bellagio Stay,Rooms are spacious and very clean.I was able to stay on the room facing the strip and fountain. Casino doesn’t smell smoke even if lots are smoking.Housekeepers were polite and accommodating and Bellagio is at the strip where we can just walk around.Taxis are always available too
2423,2.0,Not good.,The property does not live up to the expectations of its brand. Poor customer service and overall experience. The bathroom marble is chipping at various places. Staff very unfriendly. Only positive is it’s location.
2424,5.0,Bellagio stay March 2022,My fiance and I stayed at the Salon strip view room for our wedding trip. The room was exceptional and we enjoyed it. Dinner at prime was fantastic as well. The conservatory and casino were nice as well.
2425,5.0,MV's Birthday Trip,"The Bellagio is awesome from the staff to the hotel room and everything in between. They have great places to eat, and the art exhibit is not to be missed. I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Las Vegas."
2426,1.0,Not impressed.,"Rooms are small and not clean. We know the previous guest in our room had black hair. The staff seemed untrained and not knowledgeable. Just find another hotel. Flamingo, Circa, Paris, Travel Lodge, all of these are better than this overpriced joint."
2427,3.0,"Great view, but really poor service and staff","Great view, but really poor service and staff, If you have any problems, you will only hear a ""I'm sorry"" without attempting to fix it. The Bellagio truly lost it's reputation. I stayed several times at the Bellagio but the recent experience put a nail into the coffin. Avoid LV has manny better places to offer."
2428,4.0,Late Review - Birthday Trip,"We stayed here pre-pandemic for my birthday and it was memorable. The place is huge and beautiful— well decorated pools and lots of shopping areas to go to. Food is ok. The ambiance is not as energetic as MGM or Caesars, feels older. We didn’t really try the casinos - we do not gamble. The place is of course where the fountain is— perfect place to watch. Safe, grand and a more quiet place to stay in Vegas."
2429,3.0,Overnight Visit,"We were just passing through and this was the wrong place. It is pretty to walk around in the place, but it is a long walk to anything. There was no coffee in the room so you either paid a lot via room service or walked a long way. The room was nice. The staff interactions were variable (some very nice, some acted like they were doing you a favor). We were warned that if we moved anything on the mini-bar we would be charged for it. It was a relatively expensive stay and a pain in the butt. I should have thought it through before I made the reservation. ""Live and Learn""."
2430,5.0,A must stay when in Vegas!,"The most amazing experience yet! Came to Las Vegas for an influencer trip and we decided to stay at the Bellagio! The staff was impeccable and so friendly! This resort is so worth the price! Don’t stay anywhere in Las Vegas, stay here! I certainly will try to come back."
2431,5.0,Amazing! Best Hotel in Vegas,"I have heard it was the best, but now i know it is. Belagio is truly its own Vegas, Ive been 6 times and barely left the property it has the best of everything all in one location and everything else is less than a block or two away."
2432,5.0,Great hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed our 4-night stay at one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. It is a centrally located, beautiful hotel with wonderful facilities and very helpful staff. Would love to stay there again if we get a chance."
2433,4.0,AWESOME,Need new beds and pillows!!!! ADRIANNA is the BEST WAITRESS the Botanical garden was very pretty. I would recommend to a friend if they had new beds and pillows. Go to Mayfair and ask for ADRIANNA she's the BRST
2434,5.0,Great Stay For Business Conference,"i was there for a business conference and hotel was very clean, good security, good food options, staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Staff went out of their way to add a personal touch in every area. When so many hotels I have stayed at during Covid have cut back on service quality, the Bellagio was superior in every way."
2435,3.0,Are you shocked I gave it a 3 star rating? Read why..,"Bellagio is well known. It’s a beautiful hotel on the outside, they have the dancing fountains, incredible view with the right room, but.. in order to get to the guest elevators you walk through their Smoking casino. Sadly, cigar and cigarettes smoke ruins the whole ambiance of the hotel. Once you finally get to the elevators, get to the room, I stayed in the Fountain View King Room. Sadly, I was disappointed. Not on the view because it had what I asked for, a fountain view. They put me on a floor i requested, we were plopped right in the middle of lake Bellagio and it is where you want to be to watch the fountains. Channel 22 has the music for the fountains. That’s great. My GF was happy but I was disappointed. I live about 15 mins away from Atlantic City. I frequent many"
2436,5.0,Always a great experience at Bellagio!,My wife and I love this property. It’s remodel has done wonders to update the rooms and it’s one of the nicest pool areas in Vegas. The food is typically top notch and the staff was always helpful and polite. Great experience.
2437,4.0,Nice Property,Great place - only issue is to eat. Everywhere had an hour wait. Also very expensive to eat in Vegas now. Not like the good old days! Rooms were clean and nice. Just had a mile to walk to my room from the elevator!
2438,5.0,A wonderful weekend in Vegas,"Thank you for making our stay a memorable one. The only place I’ll be staying while in Vegas. The staff was great, the rooms were clean and spacious very comfortable. I will be recommending this hotel to all family and friends."
2439,1.0,"Bait and switch, poor customer service!","Argumentative customer service, tell you one thing and do another, rooms are hot. Player services treat you like you know nothing. Manager did not help. Food over priced, no help when you ask for help."
2440,3.0,Gorgeous Hotel...that's about it!,The hotel is beautiful. The rooms smelled like marijuana. The slot machines weren't paying unless you were playing $4/$5 a spin. I barely saw anyone winning any money on the machines. The food choices were very limited. We had to go outside the casino to eat. The room had a clogged sink.
2441,5.0,Very pleasant experience,"The Bellagio is one of the best casino resort on the strip. The casino, restaurants and shopping were second to none. My company was out there for a national sales meeting and customer appreciation event. The accommodations were excellent."
2442,4.0,Beautiful Bellagio,"This was our first time to stay at Bellagio and we were impressed by the beautiful interiors. The large crowd that visit the place is proof of its popularity. We were booked on the side opposite the fountain view which disappointed us but appreciated the clean and nicely decorated room. We had good dining experiences at Sadelle and Michael Mina. Staff, in general, is friendly. Our door wouldn’t lock one morning as we were leaving and a security officer stayed by the door until a maintenance guy came since we had to leave to be on time for a tour. However, thumbs down to the doorman who, I suspect, deliberately gave me the wrong direction to the bridge to Caesar’s Palace. Also, I know security is a priority, but it was ridiculous that a security officer asked us for our key"
2443,5.0,You have to go at least once in your lifetime!,"The hotel was so clean, always had staff available and always beyond friendly, out of all of the Casinos we visited - the air was the cleanest in the Bellagio! I would definitely stay again. Even though we did not get the water side view - it was still amazing. Also - floors 23 &24 are the Premier floors- and they apparently had better beds and soft water- I was on 28 (top floor) but my bed was amazing and I have bad back issues - the water was harder than I am use since I have a softener system, but it wasn't a deal breaker at all."
2444,5.0,Mother/Daughter trip,Great time with my 22 year old daughter! Staff was great and overall experience was a 10! Definitely upgrade to the strip view.... It was worth it! Only downside... tough to win money in the casino! Fun Trip!
2445,2.0,Beautiful hotel but ….,They can do better. They should do better. They have more competition now. When the dealers say there has always been an issue getting a drink. I played For 5 hours on a Saturday night and was only able to get TWO drinks. Our entire table and one next to us kept complaining. Then we took turns and bought everyone drinks at the table. Shame on them. The hotel is absolutely beautiful - the rooms were meh compared to Wynn. There is NO storage for clothes - and the bathroom had minimal amenities. We called for a toothbrush because I’m travel shampoo got on the toothbrush and was advised they do not provide and CVS was across the street. The light in mirror didn’t work. I asked For small bags to line trash can and didn’t get. Housekeeping didn’t remove trash from room. Getting a
2446,2.0,Very low water pressure,"The water pressure in the shower is pathetic. The maintenance guy they sent to take a look, told us that it's just limited to what we have, it's not just our room. Perhaps I should take my showers at the fountain they take so much pride in? The water pressure there seems great."
2447,5.0,Caring customer service,Great service at check in Great food at smack burgers Beautifully decorated for Chinese New Years. Very helpful in giving directions. Loved the large variety of the slot machines and they were spaced apart enough for me to get my walker through without bumping into people. Will definitely stay here again.
2448,5.0,An incredibly clean room and view of the fountains.,"This was our second stay at the Bellagio. The room was on the 28th floor over looking the fountains. We will stay there again! Great friendly staff! The bed in the room was very comfortable. Do not hesitate, book a room and enjoy luxury!"
2449,3.0,Nice hotel but not the best,Nice Hotel. But not the best Really nice view if you pay extra for a Fountain view window. Other than that basic rooms. My tv was not working at all. Stuck in one chanel. I really like the location kind of in the middle of everything.
2450,1.0,the room was a complete disaster,"overall, the stay was fun, outside of the room of course. the bed sheets were stained, as well as one of the towels looked like it had a pooh stain on it. I was very disappointed with the quality of cleanliness. my girlfriend and I were in complete shock. besides that, we had a fantastic time, the gambling was fun and great atmosphere in the hotel. Front desk was very welcoming and very polite."
2451,3.0,It’s getting old,The place is old compare to other hotels in the area .the casino is ok . The buffet is cheap food .Mina restaurant is good .the fountain is always beautiful. Reception is bad . The patisserie is ok . The juice bar is good.
2452,5.0,FANTASTIC TIME AT BELLAGIO,Our first stay at the Bellagio and truly it was fantastic! The room was spacious and clean and our only complaint is that we are in our 70's and our room was TOO TOO FAR from the elevators. All the food venues were great ana the staff very friendly.
2453,5.0,Wilson family,The best hotel my family stayed in the room and the beds are exceptional. Early check-in was great. Sadel’s restaurant food was awesome. The water fountain show was nothing I had ever seen. Best location for anyone's trip to Vegas. Definitely will return.
2454,3.0,Review,"When I first checked the from the app was messed up so I had to check in manually the lady that checked me in was ok, but then I had a problem the app was over charging when I went to go to the check in people to see what was going on the male had a attitude was trying to rush me off and had and attitude there was no line. When we arrived to the room first thing was to take a shower because we drove 10 hours to get there, there was womens hair everywhere in the shower. The rest of the stay was good beds are comfortable. Wasn’t the room I ordered online but it was doable."
2455,1.0,Expired chips in hotel room,"Chips placed inside room were expired. My kid got sick on the way back home. Ran into emergency room not knowing what the issue was. Later looking at back of the chip cover, noticed the expiry date was in the past."
2456,5.0,5 Star for a reason.,5 star service in practically every aspect 10/10 ratings across the board for me. The location of the hotel itself is remarkable. The drinks are off the charts and the rooms are beautiful and well kept. If you have a chance to stay here or have a trip planned to beautiful Las Vegas make The Bellagio the first and last destination for you on your trip.
2457,5.0,Class in the Middle of the Strip,"This place is by far the best place to stay the staff is excellent at the Bellagio. When you drive up and walk in them swinging doors let the party begin VEGAS BABY. Sadelle""s is a perfect place to fill up and hit the STRIP."
2458,5.0,Beautiful hotel,Bellagio hotel didn’t disappoint at all. It has beautiful surroundings and luxurious shopping stores. We enjoyed the heated pool in the winter. Easy check in for MGM rewards members. Would definitely recommend this hotel!
2459,4.0,"Beautiful! High Class, but crowded and expensive.","$31 for a Mojito at the pool bar nearly made me come out of my seat, red in the face. This was only one example. $5 bottles of water. $20 burgers. Long lines at check in and MGM Rewards Counter. Its a beautiful place and the staff was friendly, but not my cup of tea."
2460,2.0,Noise from nearby clubs means no sleep,Stayed here for 3 nights in the spa tower (a long long walk from the casino etc) every night at 12am pounding music started from a nearby club. We had to wear earplugs but the room was almost shaking. Beautiful hotel but you will not be able to get sleep here. Will not return for this reason
2461,5.0,Stay at Bellagio,"At the heart of Las Vegas strip, Bellagio offers memorable times, great gambling experience, and awesone accommodations. Staff is very courteous and attentive, decor is wonderful. Great experience awaits"
2462,4.0,Fountain view room view could be better if windows were cleaned,The fountain view room provided a nice view of the Eiffel tower but the windows weren’t clean enough for photos because you could see the dirtiness standing 6 feet from it. Security was good and staff were friendly.
2463,5.0,Fun and beautiful,"It’s was amazing, we had the most wonderful time, the resort was beautiful and the rooms were clean and fancy! I loved our room with a couch and king bed, the most amazing view of the pool. The mini bar was so cute, and the pool was beautiful and relaxing! The casino was clean and the food was delicious! Must go back soon!"
2464,5.0,Great time with my family!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Bellagio. Loved our room and didn't encounter any issues. Enjoyed being able to check-in completely on the app and printed our own room keys. For the very small things that we needed assistance with, the staff was super friendly and helpful."
2465,5.0,Vacation,"A beautiful place and friendly staff. The rooms were comfortable. The grounds are clean. The dancing water fountains were absolutely gorgeous. The only downside was the lack of quick food variety. All of the restaurants with the exception of The Snacks were high-end fancy, dress-up restaurants."
2466,4.0,"Nice, but not perfect","Beautiful resort, nice room. I will note my room overlooked a garage and I heard car alarms and revving engines at various times during the stay. The room is clean and comfortable and not worn, but feels slightly outdated. The walk from the front to the spa tower is not trivial. Bathroom amenities feel very basic. Pool is beautiful but unfortunately closes at 5."
2467,5.0,Great second stay!,We stayed here last year during Covid and were disappointed but this time we were blown away! We got a fountain view king bed and it was amazing!! The bathroom was huge and beautiful! Double sinks and a walk in door less shower! The hotel itself is beautiful and always decorated well. The gym is very large with so many different types of workouts options! This is my new favorite place to stay in Vegas!!!!
2468,3.0,"no fridge, no coffee maker, no microwave","no fridge, no coffee maker, no microwave, loooong walk to the car, next time we will stay in a non-casino hotel. check in at the desk before you self-park, or it will cost you another $18. construction going on the whole time we were there."
2469,5.0,Never dissappoints,The Bellagio's attention to detail in maintaining a quality resort after so many years is the reason it is my favorite in all of Vegas. I have stayed / visited so many others... Overall the Bellagio is in a league of it's own.
2470,5.0,Vacations,"Get away trip. Excellent time . Great room loved the food and environment. Will recommend to friends and family. The staff was energetic, friendly, helpful always willing to help the customers in all our needs"
2471,3.0,Didn’t get any sleep due to excessive noise,Called security between 12am and 4am 6 times to make the neighbors stop screaming and slamming doors and nobody ever showed up. Wont be staying there just because of this. I was a zombie for my flight the next day since I got no sleep the entire night.
2472,5.0,Fountain View Suite Upgrade and great service!,We loved our room upgrade for our first stay at Bellagio Las Vegas. What a treat. We will be back. We also enjoyed a wonderful check-out process when Sergio assisted us in taking our cart-full of baggage to the Valet area. So smooth and easy. He has been there since the hotel opened. He had some great stories about his time at the hotel and we really enjoyed talking with him. Thanks Sergio for making our check-out pleasant and memorable!
2473,2.0,Pay 60 dollars upgrade for nothing.,"At first, when I asked about upgrade, they said would give me a sunset room in the new tower, but when I get into my room, the only view I get is Caesar Palace building and highway. I asked about it to my bellman, they said this is not sunset room, and I asked to front desk, they put me back to the old tower, and refuse to refund my upgrade fee, and said give me a strip view room in the old tower and said people pay for the view room in the old tower, and when I get in, all I get is parking lot view and tiny strip view. The room were dark and old! Not worth a penny!!!! Such a bad experience for a 250/ per night experience!"
2474,3.0,Nice enough -- but next time I'll stay somewhere else,"The Bellagio is a nice hotel. However, I found the place to be incredibly smokey. In fact, it was the smokiest of all places we visited. In addition, I found the interior decor to be not nearly as interesting as Caeser's Palace, The Venetian, or the Luxor. When I looked at the fantastic ceiling paintings, huge statues, or interesting shopping arcades of the other hotels, coming back to the Bellagio was kind of a let down. Don't get me wrong--it's a clean, well run hotel, and their fountain show outside is fantastic. I just wanted their ornamentation to extend a bit more than just their lobby. I also found the ""resort fees"" to be a complete cash grab. I know that the Bellagio is not alone in charging them, but I still don't enjoy paying them."
2475,2.0,Hard to book seperate reservations and turn into one,Me and my boyfriend booked 4 nights at the Bellagio with mgm rewards. We thought they could link the reservations for 1 room for all nights. We got checked in and out and had to move rooms 4 times. They then upgraded us the last night for free. At 5am the ac broke and woke us up. It was so loud and unbearable maintenence had to come up at 530am to fix it. We barley got any sleep the last night. We also got locked out once while in the pool. We also had people checking into the same room we were leaving and another walk in on us while we were sleeping in a newly checked in room. Overall an overwhelming and terrible experiance. I
2476,4.0,Not the upgrade with my Gold card I expected,"Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio is nice but while checking in I was refused the upgrade with my mlife gold card when the person next to me did get the upgrade. I felt like because I wasn't dressed like that person they were treating me differently."
2477,4.0,Bellagio,We have stayed at Bellagio often over the years. It never disappoints. Location location! We also enjoy the restaurants. On our last trip in March 2022 we stayed in a tower room 28th floor. It appeared to be newly renovated and was very nice with a great view.
2478,5.0,Amazing stay mid-strip!,"Bellagio is one of the best locations you can book on the strip. It’s in the middle of everything so you’re never too far away from restaurants, shops, and even other MGM Grand Casinos. Rooms are great and staff was very friendly."
2479,4.0,Great but can’t get a receipt emailed to you,"Would’ve rated a 5 but….I enjoyed everything about my visit, however it is like pulling teeth to get a receipt sent to you. Ive called numerous times and someone keeps hanging up on me. When you choose the new reservation option, someone answers immediately but then gets annoyed when you request receipt from a prior stay. I was told someone would contact me but still nothing."
2480,5.0,Birthday at Bellagio Las Vegas,"Probably best service we ever experienced at a hotel. Housekeeping manager, Juana, was amazing, love her. Check-in with Dinahly was exceptional as she helped us upgrade. Concierge made my day with a birthday rose. Thank you for the best birthday of my life!"
2481,5.0,Great service,I will prefer and I will recommend everyone and all my friends and family and another people always when they go to Las Vegas trip to stay in Bellagio hotel and casino ! They also pick us from airport to our hotel with a limousine service and our driver he’s name was Jeff was a nice person and excellent service!
2482,2.0,It was sad,"My wife and I came for 6 days, which turned out to be 4 days too long. The staff seemed numb to customer interaction, and could care less beyond the abcs of their job description. Only our waiter at Lago showed any emotion towards us, that is for $400. Zero comps and a multitude of hidden fees, brutally expensive drinks and $10 bottles of water. This trip hurt my soul, I wish I had the chance to experience the Las Vegas of the 50’s-60’s."
2483,5.0,Wonderful customer service,Front desk was wonderful and very friendly. They were able to upgrade me to a fountain view and room was awesome. Everything was very clean and cirque du Soleil “O” show was amazing and very recommended.
2484,5.0,Worth it,"This was my first time going to Vegas. I was there for my bestfriends birthday weekend. He said he wanted to stay at the Bellagio because he had dinner there and loved how beautiful it was. I booked the stay and was able to upgrade our room for a reasonable price. It was worth it we had a suite and the beds for so comfortable. We travel for our job and mostly stay in hotels, these beds and comforters were the best we've slept in for a while. The staff was friendly and eager to help plan our days and resolve any issues we had. We are already planning our next trip back!"
2485,2.0,My worst trip to Las Vegas,All the staff but the manager didn't know how to merge reservations gotten through the MGM Rewards Program. Someone came into our room when I was on the toilet. No shower door + low water pressure = cold shower. Waking up to a screeching AC at 5AM and having no silence for 1+ hour.
2486,3.0,SO-SO Stay at Bellagio,"Wanted to stay at the Bellagio because it is the prime hotel at the Strip and because of its iconic fountain. But needing to pay $50 for the view is a bit too much and needing to cross the casino just to get to the rooms is not ideal. When at the room, the shower head was not the highest quality for this top hotel. Lastly, one of bell captain folks literally was hinting at wanting a tip just to store a luggage. Let me tip based on your performance, don't ""force"" me to!"
2487,4.0,Expensive but somehow falling apart,"Some things are really nice and other things were not- I had high expectations and unfortunately I was let down in several categories. The non smoking floors smell like smoke still, many room fixtures and furnishings were in poor conditions or broken, everything on site is cery expensive even for Vegas. The VIP services were very good however."
2488,2.0,"Compared to previous stays which were a 5, this one was riddled with problems","I booked the one-bedroom penthouse suite through my travel agent who booked us through Virtuoso which included an upgrade on arrival, daily continental breakfast for two guests per bedroom which was a $30 per person meal credit, $100 USD Food & Beverage credit, early check-In / late check-out, complimentary Wi-Fi. Our agent also added the VIP experience which included the lounge, free drinks, and transportation to/from the airport for $150 per day. One week prior to our arrival, I confirmed our transportation to/from the hotel and also confirmed that we had the Virtuoso and VIP experience on our reservation. When we checked in on March 2nd, we were told only the VIP experience was on our reservation and no Virtuoso. After a long wait, we were told we cannot add the VIP"
2489,5.0,Two words; Cypress Suite!,"I still can't get over the view from our room. You will not be disappointed when you open those drapes at night! The fountains and the Eiffel tower! C'mon! Also loved the his and hers bathrooms. This is one sexy room. Now let's talk about the food because we can't stop talking about our dinners and Prime, Jasmine and Mayfair. Each offering different fare, but all superb. All in all the trip was $$$$$, but treat yourselves like we did. You won't regret it!!"
2490,5.0,Great place,Great location. Friendly staff great restaurants. Rooms are clean and you can always find someone for any guidance you may need around the casino floor and surrounding areas. Casino has good games but could use a little more variety.
2491,5.0,Excellent Stay At Bellagio Las Vegas,"We were very pleased with our stay at Bellagio and will definitely return. Our fountain view room provided a perfect view of the Bellagio water show along with the strip, the service was excellent, and the meals we ate at Bellagio were very good. The hotel is centrally located and there is a complimentary tram to some of the other MGM hotels. An excellent stay!"
2492,1.0,Not what it used to be,"Terrible service, from booking, to check-in and throughout. Not sure how an overnight stay could have been more unsatisfactory. Terrible food (room service and Lago), with again very poor service. Forgotten items, wrong checks, etc."
2493,5.0,Fantastic time!,"We met some friends in Vegas for the weekend and had a wonderful time! Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were clean, beds comfortable and the hotel was clean. We saw “O”’ at the Bellagio and it did not disappoint !"
2494,5.0,Great Experience,1st trip to Vegas and loved every minute of it. Great place to stay. Rooms were large and the beds were very comfortable. Staff was very friendly and help with any questions i had. Food was great. The games at the casino were awesome. Will definitely be returning for another trip soon.
2495,5.0,WOW,"It is located in a prime location, it is beautiful, it is clean, the service goes above and beyond, the bed is so comfortable, and the view is immaculate. The price is completely affordable and for what you get, it is amazing. I will be back!"
2496,5.0,Great stay,Had a great stay. Hotel/casino is in great location. I would stay there again. The minimum betting on blackjack seemed to be extremely high compared to other casinos I have been to. That was probably the only negative I saw
2497,5.0,Amazing First Visit,"It was our first time at the Bellagio and it was everything we thought it would be. Our fountain room was clean, spacious, and had a great view. The Bellagio is in the center of everything. You still walk a ton but the location is ideal."
2498,5.0,Stay at the Bellagio,"The staff was very accommodating, and the food was incredible. Our conference was catered and you could tell the staff took professionalism seriously. My only problem was the cleaning staff walking into my room at 9:00am and waking me up, when check-out was at 11:00am. They came by two more times knocking on my door before check-out."
2499,4.0,The Bellagio,We went for fun the first room had dust on the refreshments but the next penthouse they gave us was amazing perfect fountain view would definitely stay again the only bad part is the long lines to check in it was 25 min to get the room key other then that I had a great time
2500,5.0,Bellagio weekend,"Three night stay for a party at the Monet ballroom! Fabulous accommodations at Bellagio. Great dinner at Lago, along with fun time at Lily Bar and lively time in the casino! Looking forward to our next visit!"
2501,5.0,The Best of Vegas starts at Bellagio,"Experience the strip of Las Vegas differently at Bellagio. Great location, amazing staff, beautiful rooms, outstanding shopping and dining. Iconic fountain views, easy access to the tram and great security. We can’t wait to return."
2502,5.0,Very convenient,It is centrally located. Free tram service helps you get around to other areas on the strip. The housekeeping staff are wonderful. Buffet was good. Lots of stores and restaurants. Many games available.
2503,4.0,Week-end getaway to look into buying a home in Vegas,"Just got back from a week-end in Vegas, stayed at the Bellagio. A very clean casino, though the table stakes were a bit higher than I normally like to play. Had a question about dining, stopped and asked an employee on the slot floor, her name is Stephanie Olarte of GSR... about the casino eating places and she was so nice to give us a run down of where the places were and the good food available at each. She was so pleasant to talk to, she made that day very special for us. Nice to see people enjoying their work and passing it along to others."
2504,5.0,Good Hotel,"What can you say it’s the one of the best on the strip! So beautiful, full of life and activities. Room are pretty large too! Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Fountain was amazing to see. Convenient places to get food. Beautiful interior."
2505,5.0,The best,"The casino it’s nice, clean, the staff helps us with professionalism and kindness, the slots machines are diversified, only the cocktails waitresses are not enough you must to wait to long for a drink."
2506,5.0,2 night stay,"Our room had the Bellagio fountain view. It was very beautiful. Everything was amazing, only thing was the restroom had a weird smell. The order smelled bad a times so we just kept the door closed. But other then that it was nice."
2507,1.0,dirty sheets and dirty towels,"checked into a room with dirty sheets and dirty towels. Called and complained to front desk manager for the issue, not even a sorry from her. I waited 40 minutes, no one came. I called again, and the manager said, would you like to cancel the request? I asked can you sleep on someone else's sheets??? I'm really speechless about the condition and the service from Bellagio. I thought this is suppose to be a 5 star hotel."
2508,5.0,Bellagio is above the rest,"The Staff, the rooms and the restaurants are amazing. The experience at the SPA was unbelievable. The Bellagio stall is very attentive. The food cuisine is above the rest. The O show is something that can't be compared to any other show on the strip."
2509,3.0,The Crown Jewel of Vegas has lost its sparkle.,Great location but for the price you can get in to the Nobu hotel at Caesar’s palace. Gamblin Machines weren’t working probably. The one thing the casinos fail to realize is that sometimes you just want a coffee shop close to the lobby or a food court for a quick bite. For that reason Caesar’s to me is the best place to stay in Vegas.
2510,5.0,Experience Vegas the right way.,"If you're looking for an experience, or if you want a vacation of higher living; This is the place. Beautiful decor from top to bottom, with good vibes throughout staff. This hotel makes the foundation for your trip perfect. No matter what you decide to do, coming back to this hotel will make the day that much more detailed."
2511,5.0,Marvelous accommodations and stellar service,"Marvelous accommodations and stellar service. Dawn Jones-Smith in concierge services was marvelous. The restaurants (Lago, Prime, and Sadelle’s were excellent (reservations a must). Online check in was extremely easy to use, convenient, and saved us a lot of line time. Request a lakeside higher floor room to watch the marvelous and mesmerizing fountains."
2512,4.0,Vegas getaway,"I was very discouraged by the wait times to do anything. I also didnt like that I was dropped from platinum MGM rewards status to Gold, that was completely unfair. I will rethink MGM in the future. 🧐"
2513,5.0,Needs coffee in rooms. It’s a long walk to get coffee.,The hotel is amazing and the staff is there to help. Need to have coffee in the rooms. It is a long walk for coffee in the morning. One minor problem with room but was fixed. Is also a good location for getting around.
2514,5.0,Bellagio - great weekend!,"Enjoyed a great stay at Bellagio for an extended weekend. Staff was kind, courteous and always attentive to our needs. Being centrally located, we were able to get up and down the strip for shopping and events with only a 30 minute walk in either direction. Transportation options also made it convenient when walking wasn’t a good choice."
2515,2.0,You like smoking?,Hotel is full of smoke. MGM Grand and Park zero smoking. Bellagio was full smoking anywhere anytime. If your a smoker this is your hotel. Casino staff was great and poker room was awesome as always!!!
2516,5.0,Wonderful Birthday Celebration,We stayed with the Bellagio for our first trip to Vegas and also my birthday. I absolutely loved every minute of our time spent here. The staff is friendly and attentive and everything is very clean. The decor in the lobby and conservatory was very pleasing to the eye. Would 100% stay here again.
2517,1.0,Horrible customer service,"I'm a MGM rewards gold member and during check in I did not get a complimentary upgrade as stated in the MGM rewards program. The front desk lady was very rude as I just simply asked if my offer that I booked is still intact as I showed her the offer which was the freeplay and resort credit I was suppose to receive. The lady just had a horrible attitude and without even looking just gave a rude response. ""I don't know what you're asking me."" In my head I'm thinking if you looked at what I'm asking and showing you then you will. Another thing was I got a handpay jackpot then I left the machine forgetting I had money in there. When I came back to the machine it was gone. I finally tracked down a slot attendant and asked her if there's anything they could do and she stated no they"
2518,5.0,Excellent stay,The entire stay was a great time thanks to the wonderful resort. We enjoyed the beautiful room along with visiting all the shops on the property. We are ready to plan our next trip back to the Bellagio as soon as possible.
2519,5.0,The best of the best Hotel & Casinos,"The Bellagio hotel provides great service, pool, food, view of the strip, and gambling options. The casino floor is pretty easy to navigate and location on the strip is central and next to everything."
2520,5.0,Best trip after pandemic to go on! Does not dissapoint!,"Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. We travelled for the first time after the pandemic and this was one of the nicest places we stayed in ever when we were in Vegas."
2521,3.0,It’s ok,"The stay was ok, the room average. Everything in the hotel was super expensive. We asked for a fridge and a room with a view and didn’t get either. Next time I think we will book elsewhere where there are more options and dinner don’t cost $300"
2522,4.0,Road Trip,Overall the Bellagio is a simply elegant resort. We wanted to enjoy the beauty of the Bellagio but there is no seating in the main areas of the hotel nor outside by the fountains. Not everyone who goes to Vegas is there to gamble. We weren’t but we did want to enjoy the beauty associated with the various hotels. Apparently if you want to have a seat in the main areas of the hotel you either need to be gambling or eating and drinking at a restaurant.
2523,1.0,Room was very noisy,The room I received had a connecting door with a neighboring room. This provided poor noise insulation with the neighboring room. When the occupants of the neighboring room returned at 11:30pm and were very loud and noisily which was very disruptive. My family lives in the Las Vegas area and we’re celebrating a Birthday. We decided to leave at 12:30 am and go home. I was very disappointed with my experience at the Bellagio.
2524,4.0,"The Bellagio Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas","We booked at the Bellagio, pricy but worth it. Great location centrally located on the strip. The hotel is luxury at every turn. Staff were friendly and polite, room was clean. checked out all the clubs, bars, restaurants, pool at the hotel. A memorable and enjoyable stay at this hotel. No issues or complaints. Thank you for your hospitality."
2525,1.0,Expensive room and then they try to rip you off,No coffee. Go to CVS for alcohol! Honestly was not worth the thousands of dollars we spent. They won’t give you a fridge unless you want to pay more. No coffee and the coffee places have long lines. Alcohol about 3-6 times what you can get it for across the street at CVS
2526,5.0,Fabulous 50 !!,Best 50th birthday weekend ever!! I will definitely be back to visit again. Walking distance to everything on the strip. The atmosphere at the Prime Steakhouse was enjoyable and I will remember it forever..
2527,4.0,"Beautiful, but....",Lovely property. Nice staff. Great location. Be warned that fountain view rooms are not soundproofed against loud bass music from surrounding nightclubs. Sleep at night is impossible. Expect better for the premium price.
2528,5.0,Bellagio Hotel,"The Bellagio is an excellent hotel conveniently and centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip. A full featured and comfortable facility. The pool area is beautiful, tranquil and comfortable as well. Hope to have the occasion to return."
2529,5.0,Luxury experience,"Loved staying at the Bellagio, gotta do it at least once in your life! Premiere room was newly remodeled, fresh, bathroom was huge and bright and view of the fountains was worth the extra upgrade. True Vegas experience."
2530,4.0,Spring break,"We stopped in for 3 days before we visited Zion and Bryce cannon. Bellagios water display is great and they have so many other things to see inside. Please dont buy water or crepes,both real expensive and crepes didnt even taste good."
2531,5.0,Good,"Beautiful hotel, very friendly and helpful staff. Only complaint a/c wasn’t working and it was 3 in the morning and it was to late to call and complain because I did not want to wake up my daughter and make her night a little more worse because she was extremely fussy from how hot it was in there. She’s only 8 months. So that was extremely disappointing."
2532,5.0,A feast for the eyes!,"The staff is incredibly professional, friendly, and helpful. That is what you will walk away remembering, along with the sheer beauty in every detail of this special place in Vegas! I am a repeat customer and will be back."
2533,5.0,Beautiful Casino,"This was one of the most comfortable rooms I've stayed in for a trip in recent memory. Very clean and well laid-out. The view of the fountain on the strip was a plus. I was hoping that a newer game would have been available to play in the casino, but I don't think they've installed it yet. Hopefully next time. But overall, a fantastic stay, and the staff was so friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!"
2534,1.0,Terrible staff,"We check in our room, we turn the AC a couple of hour we smell something coming out from the AC, early morning we reported it, but after the housekeeping clean the room still the smell is there, i spoke to seven staff before they accomodate to move us in different room. Not happy about bellagio handling our situation."
2535,5.0,Outstanding facility and hospitality,"We've been spoiled. Bellagio made every other resort look lacking. Staff was well trained, helpful and friendly. The facility is gorgeous. Many restaurants to choose from. Absolutely spectacular garden. Will be back!!"
2536,5.0,Highly recommend!,Made my first solo trip one to remember! Easy check in process - done in the airplane- beautiful place to stay- bed was amazing! - Prices were a bit high for in room dining /mini bar but everything was exceptional! Wouldn’t stay anywhere else when returning!
2537,4.0,Our trip,"We didn't like hours for hot tub, it's absolutely ridiculous it closes at 5pm. The shower head is really bad, it was almost impossible to take shower together for 2 people. And it's missing slippers, it was make sense to have it with the rope. Everything is good, staff is extremely nice and the place is beautiful"
2538,5.0,Bellagio Trip,"We stay at the Bellagio for our honeymoon. Overall, the hotel was amazing. Pro: The staff was amazing, front desk set the bar high. The food was great. Hotel was clean. Location, Location, Location Con: Baggage lost our first request. Had to request it twice on a Tuesday night. Overall, great stay. Will stay again. Might be our main hotel for the strip."
2539,4.0,Best Hotel on the strip,The Bellagio is our go to Hotel when we visit Las Vegas. The location is perfect in the center of everything. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The restaurants are fantastic! And the gaming floor is nice and the game variety is fun. Beautiful hotel!
2540,4.0,Spectacular Views,Can’t speak to value as my company paid for it. I have heard so much about the Bellagio that I expected it to be over the top and it was just another nice hotel with spectacular views of the fountain that can’t be beat. There is a lot of competition from newer hotels. I like softer sheets and better tp. That is not the place to skimp.
2541,5.0,Great Time,My husband and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my retirement. We had a great time and especially enjoyed our dinner at Lago's on the patio overlooking the fountains. A unforgettable night! We look forward to returning sometime soon.
2542,5.0,Beautiful fountain room views,"The property was very clean, from the first day of checking in, to the last day of checking out, and everything in between, the staff and property was/is very enjoyable. My only complaint is the slots are pretty tight. Hard to win on."
2543,3.0,Hard to get any sleep!,"Stayed 4 days, adjoining rooms are noisy, you do not get a say if you do not want one. Very loud concert on the strip, the noise came straight into our room. The pool is nice, the restaurants are all very spendy. We always ate away from the hotel."
2544,4.0,Overall Good,"Room was very nice. Check in process was pretty easy. Central location and nice casino decor. A lot of fine dining and fancy shops to choose from. However, table minimums were pretty high during afternoon/evenings."
2545,5.0,A memorable and relaxing experience,"A wonderful hotel with friendly staff, clean and spacious room, good food at restaurants, and beautiful conservatory. Being in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, with its famous fountain, adds to its value as one of the best properties, to visit and enjoy."
2546,5.0,An MGM Favorite Property,"To us, Bellagio is what we want Vegas to be. Bigger-than-life yet classy. We were treated with respect from the moment we checked in until we checked out. Room service, a hotel engineer, security, housekeeping, everyone was friendly and accommodating. We are coming back to Vegas soon and will be staying here again."
2547,3.0,Needs Updating,"Though the Hotel is beautiful, it's in need of some updating in the rooms. We were on the 23rd floor in the wellness fountain view room. Simple toiletry extras were not provided like shower caps, cotton balls and swabs, sewing kit, shoe polisher. One roulette table dealer was very rude and arrogant. Our room wasn't seviced the day before our checkout."
2548,5.0,A classic luxury Vegas staple,"Had a basic room and it was impeccable, clean, comfy beds with plenty of space. Bathroom was beautiful and clean with newer fixtures. The enormous walk in shower surrounded in marble was a hit with it’s super satisfying high water pressure. Was lucky enough to have some great weather in early March and was able to take advantage of the pool area being open during the off season, pool was perfectly heated, didn’t want to get out lol"
2549,5.0,The absolute BEST resort in Las Vegas!,"I wouldn't stay anywhere else, nothing can compare to the Bellagio and their amazing staff! The beds are so comfortable, the resort is beautiful, the selection of restaurants is fantastic, the rooms are elegant and the fountain show is breathtaking."
2550,5.0,The belligio is the best casino/hotel in vegas!,Love the belligio! We go two to four times a year and wish we went more! The food is the best on the stripe. Prime steak house needs more awards. The vibe is classy but still a blast. The rooms are always amazing and clean.
2551,4.0,Casual Food places close too early,The cafe closes at 3:00 and another closes at 1:00. So just a junk food place is open very late. The fine restaurants are open til 10:00. There needs to be a 24 hour eattinf place with all foods and that would help
2552,5.0,Another great stay at the Bellagio,"Once again Bellagio comes though with top shelf customer service and luxury experience. We returned to vegas for the Luke Bryan concert. We specifically chose the Bellagio because we can count on friendly staff, clean rooms and great atmosphere."
2553,3.0,Bellagio Visit - February 2022,This was my first stay at Bellagio and will probably be my last. Housekeeping failed to clean room after each night. I found the bed to be firmer than what I'm used to so I was not able to get a good night's sleep.
2554,5.0,Take time to visit the Fine Arts Exhibit on Bellagio property,"The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art most time has an excellent exhibit provided and it is a good way to create a calm in the fast moving activities associated with the Las Vegas lifestyle. The technological art of ""Afro Frequencies"" was mesmerizing in an intimate setting. The exhibits change over the year; I usually to catch them when I can, and the artists shop next door sometimes has good memories for purchase."
2555,4.0,Could have had better customer service,"I came in last week for a wedding and it seems like everyone else in Vegas was there for the same thing. Maybe that's why I had some issues on this trip, but I felt the customer service could have been improved. For starters, there was an issue with reservations in regards to a room rate. I booked two rooms for this stay and although the first room rate was perfect, the second one was way too much money. I had found a better deal on another website and had asked for the price to be matched, but the reservation team would not lower it to that price, so after days of haggling, I ended up having to book it on the other site, which separated my reservations, causing some issues. The team was nice enough to waive the resort fee on the room I had to book elsewhere, but it was a"
2556,4.0,Bellagio,"The Bellagio is a nice hotel and the fountain view is amazing. When checking in, the receptionist was not welcoming or kind. She seemed annoyed and bothered by us and even stated that early checkin was way later than the website clearly states. Other than that, it is a nice hotel and I would recommend."
2557,5.0,Remains Excellent,"Have stayed at the Bellagio for 15+ years and no degradation in service, excellence, cleanliness!!!! Only thing that has changed is the tables and progression toward virtual play which is everywhere. Minimum blackjack tables were $50, Craps were $25. Guess all Casinos feel they need to makeup Covid losses in next 6 months. We decided not to play tables there. Curious business model since over 80% of the tables were dark."
2558,3.0,It was fine,We stayed in the spa tower. It is so far back that it is such a hike to get anywhere. The shower head pressure was pitiful and too low. Gave the $20 for an upgrade and got nothing. Was promised a bottle of wine but had to call the front desk the 3rd day to remind them.
2559,5.0,Great room,Great room. Clean great service and great location on the strip. I would come Here again anytime. The casino was very clean the bell hop was very helpful and the tax service couldn’t be more convenient
2560,5.0,Love the hotel lobby and facilities!,"We loved everything about the hotel from the location on the strip to the lobby, atrium and variety of restaurants. However, the room felt dated with beige and tan color scheme and the bathroom wasn't thoroughly clean when we arrived."
2561,4.0,Was ok,"Clock not working in room, had to call engineers lol lol ....orange odd thing on floor on side of bed had to call housekeeping . Over all I think it's the nicest hotel in town. Just need to check on housekeeping...but the world has changed."
2562,5.0,Still the gem of the Strip,"Hotel is in excellent condition and the staff was excellent at every location whether the tables, restaurants or bell services. Couldn't have been more friendly and professional. Other than wanting to try something new I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vegas. It's truly the belle of the ball."
2563,4.0,First timeIi stayed here,"First time I have ever stay here, it was very nice, clean and the staff was very personable. I normally stay at the Mirage Hotel Casino, however I found the Bellagio to be more pleasnt and will probably consider staying here again on my next visit."
2564,5.0,Our Anniversary stay.,The room was just as we like it. The Spa Tower has been the place we have stayed since your opening. Easy access to the pool and the spa. No crowds getting to our room or the restaurant. People on the check in desk (Howard ) very accommodating in getting two rooms close together.
2565,5.0,"Great, trouble free stay","Great scenery with the fountain view rooms, anything else wouldn't worth the $$..buffet was good but expensive..should experience at least once . Elevators are fast as heck..awesome stay, was very satisfied"
2566,5.0,Bellagio Hotel Las Vegas,Bellagio is the best! Superior customer service and the folks here are always so nice! The spa rocks with all the services and the rooms are always pristine when we arrive. The Casino is so fun! The Mayfair Supper Club is an experience not to miss. Thank you Bellagio for always being awesome!
2567,5.0,Beautiful property,"Such a beautiful hotel and casino. The rooms, the staff, the food options are outstanding. Attention to detail is top notch. The gaming floor had something for everyone. Would love to stay there again."
2568,5.0,Such a nice hotel,"The bellagio recently updated their rooms and they were so nice. The staff was so friendly and very helpful. When we had an extra charge on our credit card, they had were super nice about taking care of it. Can't say enough about the place."
2569,5.0,Always a great time at the Bellagio,Mobile check in was awesome! Using my phone as a key so I never had to wait in line to check in. All the staff in the many restaurants were phenomenal. The many restaurant options made it easy to pick where to eat or have a cocktail.
2570,5.0,Took my son for his 21st birthday,"Excellent staff and service and several of the restaurants are world class. I suggest getting the mgm rewards and using the player card when doing anything, the rewards add up quickly. The front desk staff and concierge were top notch."
2571,5.0,Lots of fun!,Fun and relaxing. Andrea Bocelli concert was absolutely fantastic! Food was great and restaurants were finally all back open and easy to get into. No masks so it was very comfortable and still felt safe.
2572,5.0,Boose Wedding,"We enjoyed everything, everything was beautiful. From the room to the wedding ceremony, everything was excellent. The wedding planner was very nice and professional, I felt confident that everything would go according to plan with no errors."
2573,5.0,A weekend in paradise,Had a great stay. Hotel was beautiful and staff was very helpful. The food amenities that came with the room was out of this world. The stay was right in the middle of the strip so it made traversing easy.
2574,5.0,Birthday celebration,"Great customer service when you check in, very pleasant.However, one of the waitresses was not a pleasant as she should be, she refused to take our drink orders while we played on the slot machines. She just raised her hand and said I’ can’t right now. This was the only unpleasant experience we had. Everything else was great."
2575,5.0,Outstanding experience at the Bellagio,"Another fabulous visit at the Bellagio. Beautiful light-filled property right in the heart of the strip, with impeccable service from every department. Amazing dining options, too. We especially love Jasmine: one of the most beautiful dining rooms in town. Palio cafe, overlooking the gorgeous grounds, is the perfect spot for breakfast (croissants are the best). The only hotel I’ll stay at in Vegas. Can’t wait to go back!"
2576,5.0,Top notch service,"Bellagio never disappoints. First class all the way! From the bellman to the front desk, you are treated like a VIP from the moment you arrive. It is my go-to hotel in Las Vegas. And the Fountains of Bellagio are exquisite!"
2577,4.0,Nice Accommodations,"Great room. Good service at check-in. Strip view is very cool but not the alley way next to Cosmo which is closely in view. With mask requirements dropped most people are not wearing masks, but we know covid infections are still happening. So with large numbers of people indoors there is risk. I think this was a winter break weeks as hotel and casino areas were very full all week which is not the usual case for tues/wed."
2578,5.0,Great Stay,At check in agent asked if it was a special occasion. I said Birthday Automatic bump up since l was a long time player. A nice renovated fountain view Okay not the best view but could see alot of it. Otherwise it would have been a normal view of parking garage or what? Thank you Bellagio 😊.

2580,5.0,Fun,Great loved it as well as My 4 other friends. Mark's wedding. Beautiful room hotel room service was great. Also got locked out safe they came very fast and helped me. Love love your hotel. Your casino was not very giving.
2581,5.0,Great place to stay,This place is awesome. Walking distance to Ceasars Palace and Bally's. Lots of shops and great restaurants. The Garden is beautiful. Staff was helpful. The pools are heated. The scenery is very beautiful.
2582,5.0,Sweet And Short Memorable vacation,"Had a very good time and excellent experience at Bellagio. Lots of unforgettable memories from Bellagio . Their buffet option is awesome with all different types of cuisine , juices, pastries, deserts etc etc . Very friendly staff , rooms were clean and well maintained. Also had great time in the Casino . Looking forward again."
2583,5.0,Phenomenal,"Everything was just amazing, but we came for our honeymoon/ wife birthday and the staff just made our week 100x better strongly recommend coming here! From a free room upgrade to small gifts from the hotel staff everything was just amazing and could not ask for anything else! I do wish we didn’t find this out on our last night there, if you want to hear the fountain show from your room the channel is #22 it’s not posted anywhere and it took us 2 days to figure out there was an actual channel!"
2584,5.0,Visit for brief vacation,6 Night stay. Excellent in all aspects Beautiful suite with excellent view restaurant experience was suberb. Helpful and friendly staff Slot experience favorable slot staff very accommodating Perfect support from casino host
2585,5.0,Still the BEST IN CLASS,Our stay at Bellagio was phenomenal in all respects. It is indeed the premier place to stay in all of Las Vegas. Elegant. Classy. Service beyond exceptional. All other properties are a distant second. VIP lounge staff and housekeeping staff deserve special mention as they were flawless in pampering us. We have stayed at Bellagio many times and they are better than ever.
2586,4.0,Almost perfect,The hotel is fabulous. The restaurants are fabulous. I’d give it 5 stars if only they’d offer affordable drinking water. It’s in the desert and drinking water costs a fortune. Fix that issue and you’d get 5 stars.
2587,5.0,Wonderful weekend away,Favorite place to stay! We Always stay at Bellagio! Beautiful property with so many amenities. Enjoyed the various restaurants on site; food was delicious and atmosphere was perfect at each specialty location
2588,5.0,Great vacation,"Room is clean and service is good. Location is good. I really enjoy in staying at Bellagio. A lit of option in terms of food and entertainment including casino tables. Everything is inside resort, but other entertainment is within walking distance."
2589,5.0,Great Stay and Dinner at the Bar at Spago,"We had a wonderful stay, and they took excellent care of us and our dog. One of the highlights of my stay was dining at the bar at Spago for dinner. Regina Y the bartender was fabulous. I wanted to go to Le Cirque, as it is a favorite, but they were closed, thus I decided to just stop by Spago for a light dinner. Regina, I discovered, works a few days at Le Cirque and Spago, and she was so friendly, welcoming and personable. Her service was exceptional, and she went out of her way to make sure all of us at the bar were well taken care of. Tip: Spago has a wonderful soufflé, so definitely don't pass out up."
2590,5.0,I'lm going back,"Very friendly and professional. Beautiful place to explore and stay. Great food and staff. Check out the spa and get a massage if you have time, wow! The dealers we're so polite and helpful as well as the wait staff. Totally recommend the Bellagio"
2591,5.0,Great hotel and casino!!!,I have been to Vegas a lot over the last 15 years and never stayed here because of the price. I didn’t know I was missing out. Bellagio is now my favorite hotel. The customer service is superb and the beds are extremely comfortable. My 6 year old woke up the first day and said it was the best sleep he’s ever had
2592,5.0,Splendid hotel,"The Bellagio is one of the finest hotels that you will find anywhere. I was in town to run in the Rock 'n Roll race, and the Bellagio staff were extremely helpful in directing me where I needed to go. To my surprise, I was upgraded to a suite on the 25th floor with great views of the fountain and the Strip! The excitement of the casino, shops, restaurants, and entertainment is unmatched!"
2593,2.0,Disappointed in Bellagio casino,"We are video poker players… avoid this property.. outdated machines, broken machines and limited choices for play. We left the property daily to gamble elsewhere. For a property of this level it is unacceptable. Other strip casinos had updated vp options on machines that worked."
2594,4.0,Vacation,"One of finest properties in Vegas. The lady is beginning to show some age, but it remains one of the best. Staff service is excellent. Great location on strip with good access to other MGM properties."
2595,5.0,Beautiful Hotel!,Check-in was easy staff is very friendly hotel was very clean and beautiful. Room with a view of the fountains and we enjoy the show. We’ll definitely stay at the Bellagio again on my next Las Vegas visit.
2596,1.0,Not worth the money,There was a large fan in the hallway outside our room which we could hear all night. I would imagine something spilled in the hallway as there is an awful smell that also went into our room. In the morning while showering there was also an issue with the shower. I'm a little frustrated with the experience we have had. We tried to get the situation addressed and were told the only way to get any help was to talk to the front desk which had an incredibly long line. We finally had a chance to talk to the front desk and were moved to a room with other issues and were told we would get a $50 drink credit which never came. I am disappointed and I expected more from staying at the Bellagio.
2597,1.0,Bad rooms,Very noisy rooms Extremely short staffed Had to request to get room cleaned 3 times to get keys redone Still never worked Nuicamce check in procedure Site locked up The digital room key never worked Physical keys had to be changed 3 times
2598,1.0,Not worth it,"Having visited Las Vegas many times, my husband and I were excited to “splurge” with this stay, however we were disappointed and left feeling that The Bellagio failed to live up to its reputation. The biggest issue we encountered was that the bathtub faucet was running when we arrived in our room, and when my husband tried to turn it off, the handle broke entirely and the tub started gushing water at full force. While a technician was sent and able to repair the bathtub, the wait time caused us to have to change our dinner plans as most places nearby were closed when the repair was complete. Besides the bathtub, the ice maker on our floor was out of service for several days during our stay, the elevator card reader’s functionality was variable and I found myself “trapped” on"
2599,5.0,Overall EXCELLENT,"Check-in was super easy and the front desk clerks were efficient and kind. Our room was super clean, comfortable, dark and quiet. And the location of the Bellagio is perfect. Centrally located, beautiful decor and the fountain is amazing!"
2600,1.0,"Horrible experience, disappointing hotel response","The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel and the room was lovely; however, there was a multi-inch gap underneath our room's door, allowing all sounds to transmit readily; as such, we were awakened every 20-30 min all night long. This was before being traumatically awakened again at 5am by someone trying to break into our hotel room then urinating outside our door, leaving the stench of urine wafting into our room. Just an hour later, we were again awakened by two men chatting drunkenly in the room next door. A normal conversation should not transmit that readily through the walls of a hotel this expensive. My friend and I had saved for months for what was supposed to be an amazing 36 hour trip. As a mom of four little ones including a foster and adopted child, I have literally not"
2601,5.0,5-Star Experience,"I feel like the Bellagio is hotel everyone should stay at least once in their lives. Our first stay here totally delivered on that expectation. The staff, dining, entertainment, and hotel amenities are five stars!"
2602,5.0,Bellagio Birthday,Upgraded to a suite and was the best room we have ever stayed in! Checked in late and what a surprise treat! Strip and Fountain view from living room and bedroom. Our first time at Bellagio but not the last!
2603,5.0,Wonderful property. Great location.,Bellagio is clearly one of the best properties in Las Vegas. Property is wonderful. Rooms are adequate. Sadelle's restaurant is excellent. We also enjoyed the Yellowtail restaurant. Could offer more late nite food options.
2604,5.0,Nice stay,We really enjoyed our room and services we received at the bellagio . Everything seems to be run well and staff are super friendly and professional. My only concern would probably be the prices I guess . $22 for 1 litter bottle of Fiji water. $17 for nuts.. seems to be bit crazy but I understand it's there only for convenience and my choosing. Other than that. Great stay
2605,5.0,#1 Stay for Vegas Visits,"Our stay at Bellagio was wonderful and memorable from check-in to check-out. Using the App to check-in was quick and easy, able to print keys from the kiosk in the hotel lobby with no problem. The mobile key for parking was convenient and worked well. The Concierge was very helpful throughout our stay anytime we needed information on the hotel or surrounding areas. Our room was clean, comfortable and very well appointed; great amount of space. Room service was courteous and accommodating. Housekeeping was so friendly and helpful, greatly appreciate all that they do. The food and service at the Buffet, Spago and Snacks (best turkey club I've had in years) was top notch. We will definitely make this our #1 for out visits to Vegas."
2606,3.0,Weekend getaway,"Visited over the weekend for a half marathon. Overall hotel was nice but could use some improvements. Buffet wasn't open pass 3pm so that leaves the other restaurants which is okay but if you are doing an event that last for a while the restaurants will be closed and the only other option is the quikeats called ""snacks"" which wasn't good especially for the price. They could offer one or two more later eating options."
2607,5.0,Amazing Destination,"If you want to experience Vegas, there's no better destination than The Bellagio! The room was amazing, the staff is friendly and the entertainment and shopping options inside the hotel make it a one stop shop!"
2608,5.0,Magical view,"We got the fountain view and it made our trip magical. With the fountain music I hat you can listen to on Channel 22, it makes that hotel room priceless. The hotel is also perfectly located right in the middle of the strip."
2609,1.0,Check in experience,Worst check in experience I ever had Both the initial check in staff and the manager did not make me feel appreciated Also no one ever followed through during the stay to be sure all was wlel despite the check in experience
2610,3.0,Underwhelmed,"Small rooms, small bathrooms, dated interior, exposed minibar items that charge you of slightly bumped, check your bill before you check out. For the nightly rate you can stay elsewhere and receive better accommodations. Such as the hotel/casino next door! Good location to the strip and restaurants. Easy access to Uber pickup location."
2611,5.0,Great Resort,"We had the pleasure of staying at this resort in February and we have to say that we were impressed by all the amenities that were offered at this resort they were several varieties of choices for dining and also a gaming. Also, I wanted to comment that the rooms were very clean and spacious. If you get the opportunity to stay here I would highly recommend this resort."
2612,1.0,Don't stay next to suites,"We stayed in what seemed to be a nice room, but it turned out we were next to a suite. There must be a stereo in the suites because over 5 days we had to call 2 different nights about noise. The walls are paper thin. Then the last night the people were smoking. I called twice. It wasn't until I yelled at the front desk people that they sent security, but my room stunk by this point. I had to yell at them to switch my room and they acted put out. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere that's actually non-smoking."
2613,5.0,Amazing hotel,We always have an amazing time at Bellagio! Clean hotel and rooms. Excellent customer service and the slot machine stations are frequently cleaned. Free drinks while you play great food option and the hotel is centrally located on the strip.
2614,2.0,$48 for a kettle...double charging on parking,"There were no dryer and kettle in the room. When I called to ask for a kettle they told me it'd cost $48.. LOL. Their cleverly priced (self) parking double charges. And yes, be ready to tip everyone for everything - wanna buy a bottle of water before the show? Gotta tip. Want an entertainment trip? Go to Bangkok or Macau."
2615,5.0,Birthday celebration at Beautiful Bellagio!,"Another birthday bites the dust! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at beautiful Bellagio hotel and casino. From seamless electronic check in to again electronic check out- Everything was wonderful. We stayed in one of their Stay well rooms on 24 th floor. Beautiful decor, ultra filtered air, filtered water- Comfortable bedding! Big walk in shower- could have used a bigger shower head with big shower but not complaining! Only complaint was noise- we had fountain view and heard noise from Strip and our neighbors all night long. Still loved experience and will gladly repeat…Until next time! Thank you Bellagio for hosting my birthday celebration this year!"
2616,5.0,Excellent Trip,"First time stay at the Bellagio for everyone. First time in Vegas for two of our four person group. The services and quality is exactly what you would expect. Just don't expect any real food to be available from room service late at night. But even with having to leave the resort late at night if you want a snack, the Bellagio delivers in all other areas. It met the expectations of our pickiest companions and exceeded the expectations for the rest of us normal people."
2617,5.0,Bellagio stay,Beautiful hotel that has everything. Extremely nice and informative staff across the board. Very spacious and clean rooms. Some of the best restaurants and views in Vegas. The pool was very nice and relaxing.
2618,5.0,"Big Five ""O""","Excellent trip, our first time staying at this property. Rooms kept very clean and stocked up with all the necessary toiletries, towels, etc. The spa service was great and dinner at Prime was excellent. I will be staying here more often."
2619,5.0,Vegas Vacation,"We had an amazing time at the Bellagio! The food, drinks, atmosphere…everything was fantastic. The only issue was the lack of water pressure in the shower, but that’s just me being picky. If we ever come back to Vegas, we’ll definitely be staying at the Bellagio again."
2620,5.0,Gorgeous Hotel!,"We stayed there for a race we were doing. Convenient location as this hotel is walking distance to all of the places you'd want to go. They were a sponsored hotel for the Rock n Roll Half marathon and made sure to treat us to a special gift bag with water and treats, This special touch made us feel so welcomed. Big clean beautiful rooms with extremely comfortable beds, and large bathroom. Would definitely stay there again!"
2621,5.0,Truly fantastic,Truly a 5 star resort. All the staff was very personable. From the Bellman. To the front desk. And the concierge. Nothing but smiling faces. Always very helpful. Our room was great. Book a fountain View. Room. It doesn’t disappoint. Room amenities were very nice. Bed was very comfortable. Room was immaculate furnishings were impeccable.You do get what you pay for. And we will definitely return to this hotel. We loved the bar and the casino. We are at Prime. It is very expensive but it’s completely worth what you spend. The experience there was out of this world. Staff was awesome.
2622,5.0,Beautiful Bellagio,"This is the premier property on the strip. The central location makes travel easy. Our room, a fountain view, was amazing and kind of spoils any other room in Vegas! The food was particularly amazing as we had the opportunity to to dine at Picasso!"
2623,5.0,"Once again, a winning stay!","My husband I and I just returned from a stay at the Bellagio. Once again, the hotel didn't disappoint. Our fountain view room was well appointed and kept immaculately clean during our stay. Every staff member we encountered couldn't do enough for us. The gal at check in (Shyla), was just amazing and went far beyond and above to get us settled when we arrived in the early morning. Excellent person for a front facing position. The folks at the Petrossian Bar (Carol, Eric, Chelsa, MaryAnn, Raymond, DJ) were all outstanding. The service and food at Harvest, Spago, and Sadelle did not disappoint. We just love Las Vegas and we especially LOVE the Bellagio! Already working on our next return trip."
2624,4.0,Will stay here again,"Was here for a wedding (off-site). Decent rate using additional discounts from being a Rewards member. Easy Check-in/out but double check your room charges. I was charged for snacks in the room that were not touched, but it was resolved quickly at the front desk. Most employees were pleasant (esp the Bell Hop and elevator attendants). Rooms at the Spa Tower were a little outdated, but nothing major to complain about. Buffet was okay. Sadelle's Cafe was good and service was very efficient. Make Reservations!!!"
2625,5.0,Loved the fountain view king room!!! I would stay again,"Loved the fountain view king room!!! I would stay again. Bellagio is classy, quality and this isn't a lower class resort at all. Very nice for business, families and fun. View was incredible of the fountain"
2626,4.0,trip with son,Don't come here thinking you are going to get into any restaurants without a reservation made months in advance. the property is beautiful and very popular. I'm sure it will be even better in the warm weather.
2627,3.0,Not impressed,Hotel was way over priced for what was offered. Had to change rooms mid stay due to a malfunctioning fire alarm. The buffet was overprices at $50 per person on weekdays and $60 on weekends. There wasn't much to offer instead of buffet. There is a restaurant but if you didn't have reservations the wait was way to long. We went down on a Saturday at 5pm to use the hot tubs and was told the pool was closed. We were very disappointed in this hotel.
2628,4.0,Miss Old Las Vegas where you didn't have to spend 4 hours at a $25 table to get a beer that they now charge $15 for,"Miss Old Las Vegas where you didn't have to spend 4 hours at a $25 table to get a beer that they now charge $15 for. Corporations have ruined Las Vegas for me, the value is completely gone. Everything is overpriced"
2629,5.0,Annual Vegas Stay,"The Bellagio has always been one of my favorite hotels/casinos because the rooms are very nice, the location on the Strip is perfect and the casino has a good vibe. This time I was so happy to see that the casino has been redecorated for the first time(?) since the hotel opened in 1998. It was getting very tired looking. The newly room decor is also very pleasant, not heavy like I remember it. My husband and I enjoyed four nights at the hotel, dinner at Lago, quick morning bites and coffee at Snacks and the most convenient location in the center of the Strip. Good job, Bellagio!"
2630,1.0,Room never was cleaned during our 3 day stay. We never received clean linens or towels or had the bed made.,"The room was never cleaned by housekeeping during our three day stay. They never cleaned the room, made the bed, changed the sheets or provided fresh linens. We found a team of housekeepers at 8:30 pm one night down the hall talking and asked if they could clean our room. On top of this they charged us a daily resort fee. This used to be our go to hotel while on Las Vegas. Needless to say, we will never stay there again. The place looked shabby. They need to clean it up."
2631,5.0,Beautiful Property,"We loved the Bellagio! The Bellagio is Beautiful, clean, and accessible to everything! Love their shops and restaurants and love the ambiance of the property. Their Mobile check in process saved us long waits."
2632,5.0,Excellent all around,"Rooms are beautiful and well appointed. Front desk clerk was extremely helpful. Restaurant scene is great. Just an all around classy place. One of our favorite, if not the favorite, places to stay in Vegas."
2633,3.0,Need waitresses in casino!,"The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. The mini fridge is only for purchasing and cannot be used for personal items. Even bottled water is expensive, No coffee pot. The bathrooms are large and nice just wish there was some drawer space, The only space for putting anything is on a glass shelf that is under the sink which I think is unsanitary next to a toilet. The fountain view rooms are nice to see the different fountains. They go to midnight so if you don’t want to hear the loud water explosions till then I would not suggest it, it was not a problem for us. The casino is severely lacking waitresses. We sat in one spot for 6 hours before a waitress asked if we needed anything. She said the casino would not hire any new wait staff and they normally had to"
2634,5.0,BELLAGIO BIRTHDAY!,"Spectacular weekend with wonderful fountain views, lovely room- great BDAY breakfast at Sadelle’s -fun from the minute we got there- Til they dragged me home, kicking and screaming! Will always stay at the Bellagio!"
2635,2.0,Meh,The place is way too crowded for the amount of staff on duty. I would hope you'll start to pay your people what they deserve so you'll have adequate staff for the amount of people you jam in there. Obnoxious greed on display.
2636,5.0,Best Hotel in Vegas,"Super clean rooms, confortable beds, excellent service, friendly staff, the food is delicious. Everything is outstanding here. Prices are reasonable. The casino is clean and spacious. Shopping is always fun."
2637,4.0,Only fair at Bellagio,To many people - long lines - very expensive food - could not get massage appointment - room was very nice - security at guest elevators is lacking. High minimum gambling tables. Nice facility but they are not giving anything away
2638,5.0,We fancy :),There is literally nothing that would prevent me from staying at the Bellagio in the future! When I ordered room service it was delivered by the sweetest old man who I shared a wonderful conversation with on my wedding day
2639,4.0,Average among nice properties,"Never could call the hotel or any of it’s departments…always put on extremely long holds. This made planning the trip difficult, and made services hard to arrange during the stay ( for example, could not get room service at times…impossible to book spa treatments (couples treatments can’t be booked online), inpossible to arrange flowers for the room (wife’s birthday). Very, very noisy room….we faced the fountain, and a nearby rooftop bar was absurdly loud ….kept us awake all night one night. Thankfully it was closed on the Sunday and early weekdays of our trip"
2640,1.0,Horrible,Wrong room was provided and the pricing was so higher than hotel next door for a one night stand when I could spend $300 I spent $750! After calling front desk all they say was we can’t do anything it’s a high quality hotel! A holiday inn was providing more amenities!
2641,5.0,A lovely experience,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Bellagio! The location, staff, and food was awesome! I enjoyed the scenery and how pleasant the stay was ! Overall I had an excel trip and experience with the Bellagio ."
2642,5.0,Beautiful Hotel,This was a family trip for a couple of days following a wedding in California. My wife and son had never been to Las Vegas so I wanted them to experience this place since we were only and hour away from where we attended the wedding
2643,4.0,Bellagio is no longer a luxury hotel stay.,Standards down from in the past. Luxurious bath robes replaced with cheap terry cloth robes. Towels were not luxurious anymore and could be found at any mid-level quality hotel. Breakfast in bed was delivered in a bag with plastic ware and was cold.
2644,5.0,Will do this again.,Great Casino Experience. Loved the amenities especially the shopping it had. Great decoration around the entire place. Associate was extremely knowledgeable with what the casino had to offer. Gambling was also great. Came out with more money than I walked in with.
2645,3.0,It was fine,Everything was incredibly over priced and the room was nothing special. It had certain amenities that were nice but for a place considered to be the pinnacle of luxury I felt underwhelmed except for in the wallet. Spent $50 on 2 cups of coffee and a super greens smoothie at the juice bar. Yikes.
2646,3.0,Think twice about wedding here,"It was no a brainer when we decided to get married at the Bellagio. I have exclusively stayed at the Bellagio over the past decade a half dozen times and thought I knew what to expect but couldn't have been more wrong. We selected our wedding package and was a little put off by the extra $1000 charge for the date (2.22.22), which was supposed to be “lucky”. Then came a bit of disappointment when learning that photos in some places in the resort are off limits unless you pay an additional $1000. We declined since it was too cold for a ceremony on the Terrazo and only wanted a singular shot of our guests on the balcony while we were below. To make a long story short, the resort has made a fair number of changes dues to the pandemic. Restaurants and stores close earlier, the"
2647,5.0,Beautiful property.,"If you desire elegance and exquisite service, select the Bellagio. You will not be disappointed. We were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. We had three rooms for the group of seven. From the Guest rooms to the Prime Steak dinning for the birthday party dinner, we really felt like royalty. The Casino was beautiful and fun. I won at the craps table and my wife won at the poker table. The young adults not so much. But, they had a blast. From check in to check out, everything was amazing. Everyone was delighted. I have stayed at five other propertied in Las Vegas strip. Bellagio is at the top of my list."
2648,3.0,Stay very underwhelming,My stay at the Bellagio was very underwhelming. The spa tower is way behind technologically and it showed immediately upon check-in. upon walking in light switches on the walls didn’t work. there’s no fan in the bathroom so the only way to de-steam the bathroom was to leave the bathroom door open which caused the rest of the room to become very humid and sticky. I asked for the mini bar to be locked as I was traveling with a very active two year old. because of the age of the technology they were unable to lock the mini bar remotely nor were they able to come up and lock it. I stayed for 3 days and the tv only work part of the time. When I called to inquire on these issues I was told I’m in the “older tower” and the issues are all common. I wouldn’t have stayed here if I knew
2649,5.0,Beautiful rooms but chaotic check in process.,"Check in was insane and additional fees were ridiculous but the room was Wirth the money, we had perfect view front and center to everything. We were able to enjoy fountain from our room. Bed was amazing and soft, must be high thread count."
2650,3.0,Average,"Didn't receive my king size bed had 2 queen size, room was small and dark and had no coffee maker or a microwave or at least a complimentary water? Everything has a price cant even use the refrigerator."
2651,5.0,Family visit,"Stayed at bellagio. Very nice Ambiance, high end stores and restaurants. they have everything, you don’t need to go out of the resort. Very clean from the room to the casino. Always see someone disinfects"
2652,5.0,A beautiful hotel in the middle of the strip,Stayed 2/22-25 Fountain view room that was very clean.Shower had tons of hot water and pressure.All employees were very helpful.Dined at Lago which was very good. Beautiful property. No complaints Snacks is a great spot for sandwiches..either breakfast or other
2653,3.0,"Beautiful property, ugly policies","Our first impression of the Bellagio was everything we expected it to be. Beautiful property, friendly and professional staff, impressive décor. But once we settled in and the reality behind the façade started coming to light. Rooms. Our room had no balcony but I expected at least a window that opens or ventilation. The whole wall window doesn't open and the ventilation system is not strong enough to maintain the fresh air flow which makes the room very dry, musky, and stuffy. Coffee If you are the type of person that needs a cup of coffee to start the day, be aware, Bellagio doesn't provide coffee machines in the rooms. So your options are, to get dressed and walk quite a distance to the nearest open restaurant or to order room service, they will bring you coffee, for a"
2654,5.0,Best hotel on the trip,Bellagio stands alone as the jewel of the strip! So very pretty. The staff are wonderful. They anticipate your needs. The conservatory is a sight to behold and the entire area is changed out every 3 months. Definitely make time to see the conservatory. The gaming area is very large and has a great variety of choices. The restaurants never fail to impress. Great service and food. Bellagio does not disappoint.
2655,3.0,Don’t bring your kids. Amazing adult experience,"Amazing casino for adults. But clearly not trying to be a family resort. We will come back again when and if we’re not dragging the kids along. But for adults, this place is amazing. Amazing location and beautiful hotel"
2656,2.0,Extremely dirty bathroom,"Shower walls had hairs, and a very big slimy orange stain, lots of hair around and behind a dirty trash can, dirty stains on glass top where shower towels sit. (Extremely disgusting bathroom to say the least)"
2657,5.0,Great room,The room at Bellagio was very large & comfortable. One of the best rooms I’ve stayed in on the Strip. The online check in process was super easy. Love the Bellagio atmosphere. Lago was easy to eat at with good food.
2658,5.0,Bellagio stay,"The Bellagio is a great hotel with stores, eateries, and casino on the premises. Easy walking to other hotels and stores. Bring walking shoes! There are great food places in the area. The hotel room was very large."
2659,4.0,Vegas is back.,A reliable venue at a location coming back on to its own. They need to get all of their dining/ entertainment facilities and hours back on line now as it is getting too busy for partially opening some of them.
2660,4.0,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel but too smoky when we checked in from lobby to elevator to room, our kids have to walk thorough all the slot machines and smoke, kids get coughing badly and scared. Should have a way to hotel without passing by casino or straight to room from parking."
2661,3.0,Lovely hotel,Hotel was extremely crowded and very smoky. Numerous slots had garbage left and I did not see one person wiping down slots in between use (from Washington State) and casinos have employees who clean slots frequently. Food at hotel was not great either for the price. Good place to play not to stay.
2662,5.0,Nice stay,Young lady at the front desk was very nice. We were upgraded due to my wife's birthday. Room was very clean and we were placed on a quiet floor. Loose machines would've made our time there perfect but you can't have everything. Enjoyed our stay there.
2663,3.0,Hotel room issues,Had issues with check in on a business meeting which should’ve been an easy process it was not. I’m still getting emails under someone else’s name so I hope I’m not charged for this persons room…………..
2664,5.0,Exceptional,"Staff here really makes the difference - they're all very professional, and they are quick to offer things to make your stay more comfortable. The room was one of the nicer ones I've had in Vegas - very comfortable and clean with easy to understand amenities. Location being across from a CVS and a bunch of grab and go food places gives you a nice break from the more expensive food and drinks that are everywhere on the strip."
2665,3.0,"Leaks in the ceiling, overpriced tiny rooms","There was a leak in the ceiling outside our room, dripping into a bucket for four days. It took over a hour to get someone to answer the phone to get our bags. Complimentary does not mean complimentary when they charge several amounts totaling $600. There are so many better options on the strip that are more luxurious, cleaner, better views and bigger rooms."
2666,5.0,Great hotel. Great staff. Terrible decision to downgrade player status due to lack of play during pandemic.,MLife made a terrible decision to downgrade player status due to lack of play during pandemic. That should never have happened. There was no way to maintain an adequate level of play while there were travel restrictions and health warnings.
2667,5.0,loved it !!!!,"Staff was so kind, helpful, and knowledgeable. the hotel was in a perfect location on the strip. you can tell the staff is willing to do anything to make the customer happy. the restaurants inside were delicious !! nothing really to complain about"
2668,1.0,Don’t do it.,Every aspect was horrible. Service was awful. Homeless sleeping in chairs in main halls. Staff very rude. Room not even cleaned at 10 at night. Charged me 150.00 to use refrigerator in room. Service was totally awful. I will never be back
2669,5.0,Couple getaway,"The hotel is beautiful to say the least, the staff is very friendly and the rooms are amazing. Will definitely continue booking here for future trips and most definitely will recommend to any and all family/ friends"
2670,1.0,Raw sewage in the bathroom sink.,"I cannot recommend the Bellagio as our hotel room had raw sewage backing up in the sink. We asked for a different room and were downgraded to a much lesser room with a beautiful view of the highway, after our original room was a center fountain view. We weren’t credited for the downgrade and the front desk staff couldn’t have possibly been more terrible at dealing with the situation. So incredible snide."
2671,5.0,Great place to stay!,"Great rooms, Great views, and Great location. We will definitely be booking again in the future... only issue we had was our stay wasn't long enough! Looking forward to trying out some of the restaurants, do a little gambling, and some shopping."
2672,5.0,Bellagio,"Took a quick stop Vegas before going to Orlando. Two days and one night is more than enough time to get the gambling fix I was craving. Bellagio is always a nice hotel, and sits nicely on the strip. Be back real soon."
2673,5.0,Still cannot be beaten!,"All I can say is for the complete, classy, Las Vegas experience, you must stay at the Bellagio. The staff is incredibly accommodating and the amenities are top notch. As far as my husband and I are concerned, this is the only place at which to stay."
2674,4.0,Wedding stay,Communication between staff needs improvement. Staff members not being on the same page makes for a frustrating check in experience. This was a wedding trip and the check in process was so frustrating we almost went to a different hotel
2675,5.0,Unforgettable Experience,I can't say enough good things about our experience at the Bellagio. Oksana in VIP services made me feel like a princess for 5 days. She was seriously a rockstar! Tina at Sadelle's felt like family. Our room was magnificent. It was an amazing trip! I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vegas.
2676,5.0,BETTER than home away from home,"Amazing hotel - VERY accomodating and helpful staff, beautifully appointed hotel and rooms, delicious food at hotel restaurants. If I'm to be honest, we chose this hotel because of the Oceans movies :-D but were so happy we did! We are finicky about beds and this one was fantastic! Great views from our room and our friends' room located elsewhere on the property. Housekeeping was great but unobtrusive. Bellagio was well positioned in the strip. We were there 4 days and basically walked everywhere except for a taxi to Fremont St ($30 with tip). Would 100% stay there again!"
2677,3.0,Suite,Stayed on suite room was stuffy. No microwave no refrigerator to store food. Decor is outdated for the price. Staff was friendly. They were able to accommodate me as a breast pumping mom so that was helpful
2678,2.0,Bellagio stay,Terrible front desk service!! Very disrespectful. Requested a room location and was given a room on the opposite side of the resort. When we asked about changing rooms before we went to the room and were told to bad you got what you got.
2679,5.0,Beautiful stay,"The Bellagio is a unique place on the strip. I loved my stay, even in choosing the most basic room they offer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Walking around the property is always a treat. I would stay here again for sure."
2680,1.0,Joke….room service in a plastic bag!,"Well, just spoke with a Bellagio employee who said they are continuing to serve room service in a plastic bag unless your order is over $100. Was told the hotel makes more money and delivery staff prefer this because it is quick and easy. I have stayed at the encore, four seasons and ritz since the pandemic and they still do room service the right way. Also, good luck finding a decent restaurant open late at the Bellagio.,…joke for a so called great resort. Think holiday inn express and a few levels below that.,.that is where Bellagio has gone. Maybe the management needs to think about customer service before all else. Also, saredllis is awful. Terrible menu, bagle today was horrible, and they would not put their tuna on 2 pieces of bread for me today insisting I have it"
2681,1.0,bad i wont be coming back to that hotel the only thing was good is the fountain. The buffet was a rip off,bad i wont be coming back to that hotel the only thing was good is the fountain. The buffet was a rip off compared to cosmopolitan buffet breakfeast was 60 bucks verses cosmopolitan buffet 38 which was more higher better quality than Bellagio
2682,4.0,Don't fall for the upgrade to the remodeled tower...,"Do not upgrade to go into the newly remodeled tower. There is a sound that comes through the ventilation system from the elevators constantly going up and down that sounds like a train or plane taking off every minute or so. And this goes for most of the rooms, even the ones far away as possible from the elevators (like my roon)."
2683,5.0,Fun at the Bellagio,Our 4 day stay at the Bellagio was everything we had hoped for.staff was fantastic and extremely helpful. Overall the hotel and rooms were immaculate. Room service breakfasts were surprisingly good! We ate at the Prime steakhouse and the food and staff were top shelf! A great experience!
2684,3.0,"Very Pricey, lacking ammenities for the price you pay","Beautiful hotel, decided to splurge since we were there for our wedding. Room was beautiful, we had the strip view room, which you could also see & hear the fountain when it went off. The room had no coffee maker in the room & we had to walk down to the little cafe & the line for that place was always LONG, so if we wanted coffee it was at least a 30-45 minute wait just to get a dang coffee! Most likely will not stay again."
2685,4.0,Great stay and fantastic dining!,"We opted for older rooms in the newer tower (than newer renovated rooms in main tower) because of the bathtub - newer rooms don’t have bathtub. Front desk was very courteous and helpful in informing us the new change that took place starting Feb.1, 2022- with gold and above memberships resort fee and parking fees are waived! I didn’t even need to ask! Restaurants are fantastic in Bellagio! We dined at Picasso and really enjoyed the experience. Every staff was so nice and friendly, didn’t feel pretentious at all. The only minor complain with the hotel is the coffee place ( crepe and chocolate place.) There aren’t so many places in the entire hotel one can grab a morning coffee! So the line was super long every morning!! Room is clean and although we didn’t get a higher floor ("
2686,5.0,Great vacation at a phenomenal Resort,"Stayed at Bellagio for my birthday using VIP services and all was on point from services, drinks,foods you named. hopefully i can return before summer is over for some pool time my only regret is not been able to stay longer."
2687,5.0,Great visit!,Thoroughly enjoyable experience. I always enjoy the Bellagio. Great location and the staff seem a cut above other Strip locations. Lots off positive changes here as Vegas enters into its new phase of expansion along with a ton of new attractions. Fabulous stay.
2688,5.0,Great Hotel,"The Bellagio is a great hotel for a stay, especially for a special occasion. After numerous trips to Las Vegas I finally decided to stay at the Bellagio. It was well worth the price, if you want a good discount I suggest staying Monday thru Thursday nights. You can get a great discount through the MGM site/app, for a weekday stay. The room is very big, exceptionally clean, upscale, with an amazing view. This is a great hotel, I highly recommend staying at the Bellagio."
2689,3.0,Nice but expensive for what you get,"Hotel is pretty nice but expensive for the size and what is included. Bed was not very comfortable(felt very old) and room did not cool very well and shower water pressure was very low and took a while to get warm. Needs more options for quick snacks or coffee, especially in the morning. Just to get coffee took 45mins."
2690,5.0,vegas Getaway,we have a nice vegas vacation because of Bellagios free accomodation. we will definitely come back here. The lobby has a nice spot for picture taking and the hotel is in the center of vegas strip. thanks

2692,1.0,Waste of time and money,Same service at Motel 6. Staff was very unfriendly and not helpful. Pot heads all over outside. Restaurants were not open of full. Food and drinks in room were crazy high priced. Not much to walk to without a taking several pathways.
2693,5.0,Lovely place to stay in Las Vegas,"If you are coming to Las Vegas and want to stay somewhere wonderful on the Strip - this is a great hotel. It is beautiful inside and out. The staff is wonderful from the Doorman Buddy to all the housekeepers. It is more than a little busy and if you sat in the reception area, you could spend the day people watching... especially all the wedding parties. But why would you? You can get anywhere from the Bellagio. The rooms are beautiful. The pool is beautiful. There is good shopping, great restaurants and gambling, if that is what you are there for. Upstairs is quiet. The work out center is great - even if the hours are awful (9-6 isn't great for those of us who wanted to get up and do an early morning work out). If you are looking for a great hotel for your stay in Las Vegas,"
2694,5.0,A wonderful hotel,"Everything was great about this hotel. The room, service, cafes for breakfast in the morning (great coffee), location, pool, staff, fountains, lobby ( Permenant and seasonal decorations for Chinese New Year).

If I can attach pics to prove it I will. Again 7th floor fountain view rooms are a rip off unless you just paid for a regular room. Do not accept 7th floor fountain view rooms. This hotel is no where near what it used to be."
2698,4.0,Pro Bowl Weekend,We spent The Pro Bowl weekend Game . Busy. But yet able to walk around and enjoy the stay. Tables on high end. So slot machines was our main gambling time. Overall staff was on point. Valet was great.
2699,5.0,Best hotel ever,Everything you want and need in vegas you get it here with class. Everything from food to parking it was amazing . They really took the time to make sure the luxury of this hotel was truly top notch. Will come back
2700,5.0,Awesome,I would refer anyone to Bellagio it was amazing. Very good customer service and welcoming. Room was clean and they went above and beyond. The food was amazing and shopping was amazing. Love the casino
2701,5.0,Great again,"As always my stay at belagio was excellent. I started staying at belagio 3 years ago and have never been let down. The suites are spacious and have most amenities anyone could ask for. However there may be room for improvement... how bout a coffee maker? With coffee included. Also, the suites are all the way at the end of the longest hallways over ever been down."
2702,5.0,Great experience great customer service and wonderful hotel,Excellent great customer service and wonderful staff for it was my first time in last vegas I had a wonderful time and wonderful experience in bellagio room service was great workers were wonderful and friendly a lot to do inside the hotel and everything was so nice and clean and fresh
2703,4.0,"Beautiful hotel, missing some mid range perks!","Very large hotel, make sure you always have comfortable shoes! Heat/AC woke us up a few times a night, cycling on and off. I like to drink coffee in the room while still in my PJs but there was no coffeemaker! The first time ever that I found that in any price range hotel. Had to hike a few miles, once I got dressed, to the Starbucks by the front door!"
2704,1.0,5 start hotel offering not even one star service,"Pro: None Cons: Old hotel, old decoration with dark old bathroom and crappy dark lighting. Asking $600+ for room deposit. No girls coming by if you need drink when gambling unless you are unloading boat load of money and not at slot machines. If you want to gamble and sleep late on your check out date and have no issue paying additional money for later check out, then these morons at MGM Bellagio expect you to get up at 8am and call the manager to see if you even get granted late checkout that costing you additional 30+ dollars. Bathroom in the buffet dining room old, dark and filthy. Heat pump in the room even at 6th floor pulling in smoke smell into the room since Bellagio employees taking break and smoking outside on the 1st level. MGM properties including Bellagio"
2705,3.0,Over rated,"For it being in a decent position on strip, I expected WAY more for what they charge. Our Queen room was old and small. Don’t believe the hype, also I disagree strongly with these silly “resort fees!!”"
2706,3.0,Not 5 Star!,Took an hour to check in. Then room was dirty. Hair in sink and tub. A/C unit was broken in room of guests traveling with us. There solution was a floor fan brought up in the middle of the night. Really! Not the way to celebrate a 21st Anniversary. Very busy hotel which leads to poor customer service. Would not recommend.
2707,3.0,My Birthday,The experience was uneven. The personal service and most of the food service was commendable but the sleeping room was of poor quality as it was old. It was annoying that the safe was locked when we got there and the hotel staff were demanding and finger-pointing. They need to be educated how to treat paying guests.
2708,5.0,Great location and luxurious atmosphere!,"We wanted a centrally located hotel that would offer a very luxurious pool area and high comfort level. This place is perfect for families, couples or work travel. It would be easy to never leave the hotel and have a wonderful trip. It was great to plan excursions and make evening show and dinner plans with the help of the concierge who made everything so easy and the pricing was better than what we found online. With the tram right at the hotel that joins a few other MGM properties, it was easy to travel to one of our evening events and shortened walking time. The hot tubs were clean, nice and hot and big enough to not feel cramped at all. I was very happily surprised by the pool area and me and my adult children loved hanging by the pool and hot tubs every day. We had brunch"
2709,5.0,Boom!,Bellagio rocks! Great food. Great staff. Accommodations and cleanliness was everything desired. The staff goes a step above other casinos without a doubt. Hands down will stay there again for sure. Will be my first choice.
2710,1.0,If you want drugs or hookers this is the place to go,Drugs and prostitutes offered nightly. The once iconic Bellagio is now fallen to this rampant exploiting of guest. You might expect this from other cheaper hotels but even four and five star hotels like the Bellagio seem to be rampant with this now. Vegas isn't what it used to be
2711,5.0,Incredible!,"Always enjoy the Bellagio. I don't even consider other hotel/casinos. Everything was wonderful including the room, fountains, casino, Prime steak House, Lago restaurant, Sadelle's restaurant and the ""O"" show. We had so much fun!"
2712,5.0,Great Stay,"I loved this hotel. Everything was great, the room was very quiet and they gave me an unexpected fountain view room which was amazing. Food was great and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely stay here again."
2713,5.0,Most relaxing weekend in a long time,"We stayed at the Bellagio for a weekend and we were so happy with the stay, we wanted to stay. We are always ready to get home, but this time we wanted to stay. The casino is busy, but the walkways are wide enough that no one runs over you. The room was very comfortable and there are plenty of places to eat and get coffee. I highly recommend the Bellagio!"
2714,3.0,Not as important,Not as important of a guest if not vip. Was told when arrived are room was given to a vip player . And to pretty much deal with it. We asked nothing for free. But we were told that’s hotel policy. I said then why book reservations. No answer
2715,5.0,Still great,Bellagio Is a great hotel and casino! The only issue I had on my last visit was Sadelle Which replace the Bellagio Café a few years ago. Do not waste your time there. It is overpriced for average to below average offerings. There are lots of other choices for a quick bite use them -
2716,5.0,Bellagio is the best!,"The Bellagio has become our go to place to stay in Vegas. We come here 5-6 times a year and always stay at Bellagio. Most of our gambling is done here as well. Over this recent trip my wife only left once to go eat somewhere else then returned and never left again the 4 nights we stayed. Even if we wanted to leave, it's central location on the strip provides access to almost everything. From the table games to the slots, everything is phenomenal! We love Spago, Noodles and Yellowtail for places to eat. The 24 hour snack place is awesome for those late night munchies. The beds and pillows in the room make it easy to sleep in and lounge around for a while if you need a break from gambling. We can't wait for our next trip which is already planned for April. We may even"
2717,5.0,Once an a lifetime experience,The lady at front desk was so nice she help me to upgrade my room to a better one that acomódate my kids and my self and the staff at the hotel was very helpful and nice I couldn’t have ask for anything else
2718,5.0,"Comfortable Room, with a great view!","Our room was comfortable with a great view of the lake. We enjoyed watching the fountains every night during our stay. Our bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spectacular. The only problem was when calling downstairs to the front desk, it took a while for someone to pickup the phone."
2719,5.0,"Great place, great people, great time","Relaxed, enjoyed the scenery and the Bellagio really makes everyone feel like a million bucks. Everyone that works there truly loves their job and created a time to remember and will last forever. Thanks Bellagio"
2720,5.0,Great atmosphere. Friendly and attentive staff.,Staff really makes you feel welcome. They’re very attentive and detail-oriented. This is a family-friendly property. Lots of great dining options. Would definitely go back and recommend to family and friends.
2721,5.0,Excellent stay,"Everyone was super helpful and friendly and the atmosphere was outstanding. The food options are first class and the location is probably best on the strip. The water fountain show was amazing, will definitely be back."
2722,5.0,Amazing!,My husband and I truly enjoyed everything about the Bellagio! From dining and shopping to just walking around. We can’t wait for our next trip! Thank you to all the team members- you have earned our loyalty!
2723,5.0,Favorite View,There is nothing like looking out from your room at the Bellagio fountain and the beautiful Vegas strip at night! For me it’s a must stay every trip out also the pools are fabulous and no shortage of amazing food at the Bellagio!
2724,3.0,Birthday Trip,"Upon checking in and arriving in our room we were impressed with the room and view of the Paris, then we noticed a food container on the night stand that had eaten pieces of watermelon in it and noticed that there was imprints on the bed that someone had been laying on it and key cards thrown on the floor. We called guest services and were given another room on back side of the hotel. We got into our new room and it was warm, had A/C looked at and they changed the filter and gave us a 3 speed fan."
2725,5.0,Loved it and I can't wait to return,"Excellent customer service, beautiful rooms and casino, lots of dining options, and one of the best locations on the strip. My wife and I can't wait to return. The Bellagio provides classic luxury without any pretentiousness. You will not be disappointed."
2726,5.0,Great place to stay,"My room was cleaned on a daily basis, the staff was very courteous and helpful, and there are great dinning options. The location is center of the strip which makes it easy to walk to other places or take a tram."
2727,2.0,Poor customer service for luxury hotel.,"Poor dining options before 5pm, bad customer service and terrible drinks made for a bad experience. Not what you would expect from the MGM groups flagship property. Would not recommend to friends or family."
2728,5.0,"Great hotel, excellent staff","We got a free stay here, and I'm sure we didn't get the ""best room"" but it was still very lovely. Amazing bed, excellent service, great location. The buffet was so good, we got to sit at the bar (did you know you could skip the line and just go sit at the bar!?!) and we had a great time. I can't wait to bring my kids. (don't worry, they're cool.)"
2729,4.0,Room was marvelous. Staff was meh.,"we booked a 2 bedroom penthouse suite with fountain view. It was SO worth it!!! Restaurants were lacking in reasonably priced options. Essentials stores weren't well stocked. Room was fantastic, but staff were not very good at communicating."
2730,5.0,Amazing,This was a wonderful experience overall. The penthouse suite was perfect. It was large and modern and well done. The staff was friendly and always extremely helpful. The dining experience was phenomenal.
2731,5.0,Family Vacation,"Loved the hotel and casino staff, bell services was fast and very professional! Parking was always available and super easy to get in and out. Went to the SNACK place for an early morning cravings and their pizza was on point!"
2732,4.0,Stay at the Bellagio,Checking in was quick and easy. The lady at the counter was very knowledgeable and loved sharing any and all information with us. Fountain was loud at night and kept us awake and the room was very warm even after adjusting the thermostat. Room service was great and very polite.
2733,3.0,Poor service,"The service at the Baccarat Bar on 2/18 was abominable, empty tables everywhere and the waitress said they were full, hostess nowhere to be found, once seated took forever to get a drink while waiting staff congregated by the cash register."
2734,4.0,First trip of many I hope.,"Very nice and clean. Casino staff very friendly. Food was great. I didn't want to visit another casino, I was happy just staying there and didn't feel a need to leave. Looking forward to visiting again!"
2735,4.0,Great - but beware noise at weekends in Fountain View rooms,"This hotel ticks a lot of boxes - location, amenities, pool, cleanliness, choice of restaurants, size (big but not so big to be a maze). However - fountain view rooms are incredibly noisy at night at weekends due to the presence of nightclubs opposite the hotel. They go on until 4am and are LOUD, even through soundproofed windows (and I’m amazed there aren’t more mentions of it on here). We ended up moving rooms at 2am - Bellagio were very good about it, and our stay was great after that - but be warned!"
2736,4.0,Good stay,The Bellagio is a nice hotel with nice hotel rooms and an extremely friendly staff. the only downfall to Bellagio as it's very expensive restaurants and shopping but very close to Affordable places and exciting places that are all within walking distance.
2737,2.0,Disappointing first (and last) stay,"Been traveling to Vegas for years and always wanted to try Bellagio. Thought the experience would be similar to staying at Wynn. Boy was I wrong! The room was comfortable enough and it had a very nice, large bathroom. Decor was in good shape, but unimpressive. I would liken it to a Hilton Garden Inn - nice but nothing special. Platinum status means nothing here. Got a room on the lowest floor with a horrible view. Was supposed to be able to get a better room in ""2-3 hours"". Called twice and there was supposedly nothing so gave up. Was supposed to get a call to be upgraded the next day also and it never happened. Housekeeping thankfully was much more responsive and did a good job. Valet was hit or miss. One night we waited in line to valet for close to 15 min."
2738,5.0,"Nice hotel, great location.",Hotel was very clean and the staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Prompt room service and nice casino to play in. Bellagio is always one of our first picks to stay when we travel to Las Vegas which we do often. Looking forward to the next visit.
2739,4.0,"Nice rooms, great location!","Had a great time in Vegas watching the Super Bowl, celebrating Valentines Day and seeing Luke Bryan in concert. We had a nice view of the strip & Bellagios fountains. The weather was warm enough to sit by the pool and relax."
2740,5.0,Great place,Great place to stay. We saw the fountain show twice in the daytime. Staff was very nice. Rooms need to be updated a bit….all in all it was a great place to stay especially because it’s located practically in the heart of the strip
2741,5.0,Nice property and enjoyed the stay,"Just back from a weekend at The Bellagio and enjoyed it overall. The Casino was very tight. The room was clean and had a great view. Not quite sure why the VIP check in wasn’t available for A Platinum MGMRewards card holder. I use that check in at The MGM, Park MGM, but was told I shouldn’t have used it at The Bellagio. Doesn’t seem consistent having the Guests try to guess if they can. I would imagine if it can at one, it should at all of the MGM properties."
2742,5.0,Bellagio - the best part of Vegas,"I've stayed at the Bellagio twice, been to some of the Vegas shows, been to the Grand Canyon, both by tour and by helicopter, been to Hoover Dam, and still my favorite part of Vegas is the fountains at the Bellagio. They are amazing to watch. Also, compared to some of the other motels the Bellagio seems to be more airy, not so closed in"
2743,5.0,Do not take room 33 on any floor. The service Elevator goes abuts the room wall. Runs all day and night.,Do not take room 33 on any floor. The service Elevator abuts the room wall. Runs all day and night. When I ask to me moved they offered to move me to another floor with the same number room…same problem other than that the hotel is fantastic. I give it too marks on everything else.
2744,5.0,Helping,"Abigail Vinson from the store she’s in tutto dept she did above and beyond. I had just blew thru 3 grand gambling and my phone died I needed to charge it to use my cash card which was on my phone I walked around the whole casino with no help from anyone at all and honestly treated very poorly, she was the only one that made the appoint to take my need into consideration I’m very grateful for her help after charging my phone I purchased not only the 30 dollar charger but some more things and then continued to gamble after. Thanks to her I will still stay here"
2745,5.0,Petfect,Everything was fabulous from the service to the food to the casino staff/everyone. We will not hesitate to come back ever again. Perfect location on the strip and everyone had a fabulous time. I would not hesitate to recommend this property to anyone. And life rewards makes it even better
2746,4.0,Worth the money!,"From the moment we showed up, to the movement we left, the staff were amazing ! So welcoming and friendly. Upon arrival, we were offered a room upgrade - very cool to watch the fountain show from our room. Every inch of the room was clean. Only down side, it was hard to find a midnight snack. There was only 1 place open and it took almost an hour to get food. We will be back!"
2747,1.0,Do NOT Stay in Fountain View Room,"The bass is SO loud from the outdoor clubs nearby that you will not be able to sleep. Trust us - even with a very loud white noise machine, you will feel the bass from the pillow into your head. It’s the most awful experience we’ve ever had at a hotel. Also, we asked the staff to put a disclaimer for these room types and they told us they know they have a problem but would not put a disclaimer because they said it’s Vegas to people expect it to be loud. The bass from the club goes to 6am so….. my gosh!"
2748,3.0,Was hoping for more,"We surprised our son for his 16th birthday and thought Bellagio would be a great place to stay. At check in, the staff tending to us was agitated, but it was late when we arrived so maybe it had been a long day for him. We booked 2 rooms at the same rate and while one looked over the beautiful grounds, the other stared at a wall. The lines were long and the MGM service desk was unattended. Was hoping to love the experience but it was the first and last stay for us at the Bellagio."
2749,5.0,Excellent Casino Resort,Amazing place to stay & play !! The stay was very comfortable & the Casino is excellent as well. Tends to get very crowded but that’s expected as lot of folks come in to see the Casino & the very famous fountain show!
2750,5.0,A great weekend getaway,"My husband and I had a great weekend getaway. We had a wonderful experience from beginning to end . The check in was smooth , the room was so clean and no matter who we asked when we needed help was super helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back !"
2751,4.0,Bellagio for the win,"This was our 2nd time to stay at the Bellagio. It is a beautiful property and right in the heart of the Vegas strip! The rooms are spacious, however they do not have a mini fridge or a coffee maker. Bring water!!! We paid for a fountain view room this time and were a little disappointed in this (our room was way down on the end so we really couldn't see the fountains unless we stood at the window to watch). Perhaps you can request a more central and higher floor room (we were only on the 7th floor). Other cons to the hotel: you have to walk through the very busy casino to get to the elevators, the water pressure in the showers is pitiful, and the table minimums are high. With that being said, it is a very luxurious property with all the amenities that one expects. The bars and"
2752,1.0,Pretty Mess,Very bad service. All around. The only helpful person was a very nice young African American man. He was a floor person who was walking by and I asked him for directions. He immediately offered to walk us to our elevator which we truly appreciated because we were completely lost. It was all downhill after that! It was our 25th anniversary and it was the worst Las Vegas trip ever.
2753,2.0,Room extremely noisy.,Loud music from outside until 3AM. It was impossible to sleep. The room was clean but the AC was not working properly. The aisle in my floor was dirty and there were lot of glasses on the floor that stayed there during my whole stay.
2754,5.0,"Excellent rooms, amenities and location","First time taking our teenage kids to Las Vegas. We couldn’t have picked a better hotel. The restaurants were excellent- Lago was our favourite for brunch, and the patisserie place. They also have a juice/smoothie bar we loved. The rooms were excellent."
2755,5.0,Amazing stay,We had a wonderful time. The hotel is amazing. Staff is very professional and helpful. Our room was so comfortable and we had the best view of the fountains. Even the parking was easy and convenient. M
2756,2.0,Not impressed at all - won't be back,"Between the mold in my bathroom, the shower that flooded every time I used it, being overcharged almost $300.00 in mini bar charges because I made the mistake of touching a couple of items to make room for my water, and not having a fridge in the room to begin with I was not impressed in the least bit with this hotel and will never be back. Also the entire hotel reeks of smoke, non-smoking floors included."
2757,2.0,Greedy hotel,"Great location, bed were comfy, other than that terrible room, water pressure sucked bad. Greedy hotel u had to pay for everything coffee, water...just would stay at another hotel 1000% next time. We wanted to stay there for the name but clearly was a mistake. We won on tables but slots don't pay, didn't hear anyone playing slots cheering. Always heard they have their slot machines setting turned up not to pay"
2758,4.0,Bellagio,Our first room 14031 was not clean the bedding had a odor the room had an odor the bathroom had a sewer smell and the robes had a body odor smell. Second room 27011 was better except bathroom had sewer
2759,5.0,Always good to go back to Bellagio,"I've been coming to Bellagio for over 25 years. Always a good time. I traveled predominately solo. Always feel safe, secure and well taken care of at Bellagio as a single traveler Will return over and over."
2760,5.0,Great Hotel! Bait and Swith Reward Points,"Hotel experience great. MGM Rewards are a Bait and Switch. Purchased show tickets through Axis as advertised at MGM, was not allowed points byMGM Rewards. Rip off of 500.00 dollars plus. Use caution! Don’t Trust MGM Rewards!"
2761,5.0,Great Hotel in Middle of the Strip,Bellagio is my favorite strip hotel. The service is impeccable. The best parking garage and beautiful casino. Easy access to other casinos from this location. Stay here for a guaranteed great experience.
2762,5.0,Excellent,"Excellent hotel. We stayed for one night as we were catching the red eye back East the next day. Had a late checkout at 3 pm. Enjoyed the pool and lunch. Took a nap and they held our luggage while we went exploring, having dinner and caught a show. Then picked up our luggage and went to airport"
2763,2.0,Simply put: Overrated,Very noisy and outdated rooms. The hotel has amazing common areas and great restaurant options but you can find far better rooms in the strip for the same price. I recommend Bellagio just to visit and have dinner.
2764,5.0,Best Valentine’s (week) Ever!,"We found the staff and service in every department to be extremely friendly and helpful. Our fountain view room was clean, comfortable and perfect. Restaurants and lounges were great experiences. Highly recommend a stay at Bellagio and a visit to all restaurants and lounges. No complaints to note on food or service. The opposite actually as every experience was top notch."
2765,3.0,A lot of money for a mediocre stay,"It’s time for the Bellagio to take inventory of their property. Remodel the rooms - upgrade housekeeping - but the casino is on point! Make sure housekeeping actually cleans the rooms during a stay. And when a guest calls for service, don’t blame them for not receiving it."
2766,5.0,Bellagio…Fist Class!!,Without exception of the Bellagio as mine and my wife’s favorite destination when we travel to Vegas. The king suite was immaculate and luxurious. The restaurant options were amazing. The casino staff and Casino Host truly made us feel at home and relaxed. If you haven’t been there give it a shot!
2767,3.0,Bellagio stay,Bellagio is a tired old hotel that needs a makeover. It lacks the modern trendy look and smells like the Excalibur. I remember the days when it opened.... Staff is great and works hard. Most don't understand how MGM rewards works and give a lot of bad information. You are left disappointed when checking out and they have to clarify with manager for everything . I understand hiring all new staff is hard but please train them well and give them flexibility for service recovery.
2768,5.0,Top Notch Quality,"I can’t say enough about the staff at Bellagio. This place is upper echelon, top quality and a smoothly-run operation. Every employee I encountered was terrific, from the sales team all the way down to the janitors. This is the place to go in Vegas in my opinion."
2769,2.0,Too expensive to not be clean.,"The first two nights we stayed the room was extremely hot. They finally fixed the issue. However, we were never offered any compensations or refundd for being miserable for 2 nights. The bathro had old toothpaste on the mirror and hair in the tub and sinks. The floor had food that was pressed into the carpet and hard. For the price you pay, this should not be an issue."
2770,1.0,Check out Experience,The checkout staff was very not understanding of situation and making the wrong judgment cording what was promised to the client. Very disappointing and the most embarrassing moments of my life this is not right
2771,5.0,Lovely stay,"The stay was lovely. The walk to the spa tower was further than we had liked but the view was worth it. We ate at spadelles for breakfast twice, highly recommend it. Prime was not as good as expected but the fountain view outside made up for it. Overall a very nice stay."
2772,3.0,Bellagio is getting old,"Even though we still stay at Bellagio, I can see the decline in some areas. The pastry shop is no longer a French pastry shop quality but more so a Mexican pastry shop quality w/French prices. Check in, Check out clerks are no longer able to keep the high standards of customer service. Also the quality of the service staff at restaurants are declining, eg hostess at Noodles."
2773,5.0,MGM Rewards,It’s been years since we stayed at Bellagio. The room have been remodeled. This review is for the great service we received at the MGM rewards desk. Naturally since we haven’t been here in years we needed our rewards card. Corliss was so patient with us. We didn’t know they match status so she had to redo the whole process over. She was very friendly from beginning to end.
2774,5.0,Excellent,"The Bellagio is one of the best hotels in Las Vegas, Classy, clean, and wonderful places to eat. Friendly service and the fountain, quite the spectacle.! It was our second visit to the hotel, we went to see Cirque du Oleil (again) and had a great time."
2775,1.0,Better off on the street,This was beyond bad. No service. Spent money on a suite and was given a room with a busted TV. No refrigerator. The hallway smelled of mildew. I found that my friend staying at another hotel had more to offer than the luxury suite that I paid for.
2776,4.0,Beautiful fountains and a comfy bed!,"Wonderful resort. Didn't get to do everything on site, but would definitely go back. Upgraded to a fountain room, very good choice. Channel 22 has the music for the fountains. I think we could've watched that all night, every night. Overall a good sleep. Comfy bed. Clean room. Fantastic shower - gets very hot and has great pressure. Rooms got a little warm overnight and one of the trash cans wasn't emptied between the last guests and us, so that makes me wonder a little bit about housekeeping, hence why 4 stars instead of 5. But overall a good stay."
2777,4.0,Finally made it to the Bellagio,"This is a top tier casino/hotel and I finally got to stay there with MyVegas points. The lobby is so beautiful and the conservatory is wonderful. I had to go to MGM Rewards first to match my Caesars Diamond status to get MGM Rewards Gold. This allowed me to check in through the VIP line which moves much faster than the normal line. But, I also had to remind the check in lady that I don't pay resort fees because of my Gold status. The room was nice - I had a view of the pools that stay open year round. Beware of the snacks and items in the room because they cost a lot and are motion sensored. Also, the glass shower was strange because it didn't have a door. Overall, this is a nice, expensive luxury hotel that has a central location. I'd recommend it if that's your"
2778,5.0,Bellagio Resort,This is a beautiful casino. Employees are wonderful. Slots do NOT pay out. Enjoyed the restaurants and shows. Conservatory is always beautiful. Sadelles is a great place for breakfast to start your day. Make reservations - lines can be very long.
2779,5.0,Bellagio is world class,"We stayed as a family at Bellagio and it was excellent. Staff was friendly and restaurants serve delicious food. Visited Harvest, Mayfair supper club and Spago’s all were great service and food. Centrally located on strip. If your an MGM gold member or above, no more resorts fees!"
2780,1.0,Dirty Room,My five year old daughter opened up the dresser drawer to put her toys in and there were dirty old crackers. We usually stay at ceasars and their rooms are clean. This was our cirst time at balagio. I won 700
2781,2.0,"Two stays, three months apart.","Both rooms were noisy, not providing a good sleeping environment. Restaurants did not give priority to guests and lines were very long. Few interactions with staff, but no complaints there. Valet was extremely slow, but friendly."
2782,3.0,"You book for a dream stay, the reality is OK","What the hotel does right: Large, spaciaous rooms and bathrooms, plenty of room to relax and spread out Room Service-The 24 hour room service is delicious, well presented and has an extensive menu Pools-The pools are exceptional, dream like even. I didn't get to go, but they look incredible Where it could be better: Check-in-The woman who checked me in in the M-Life gold line was so cold and short with her responses, she just wanted to check in me as fast as she could, sell me upgrades, stick to her script and try to avoid answering any of my questions about the property. Check out-When i checked out, i needed a paper copy of my bill and i didn't receive the email. The M-Life Gold line was closed in the morning!!!! So i had to wait in the main line which took more then 20"
2783,5.0,Very confortable,"Casino area is wonderful and hotel room is spacy and comfortable. Completed all check in and check out process via app without any personal interaction with the hotel staff. They also offer an option for late check out or early check in, which in my case was very helpfull. I highly recommend."
2784,5.0,Love this hotel!,"Love this hotel! Staff, rooms, everything about this hotel screams luxury and fun! I would highly recommend this hotel! Our room was huge and added to our wonderful vacation! Every interaction was positive!"
2785,5.0,Great property - Lovely room - Amazing staff,Great place to stay. Pool area is great - Amazing Staff- Value and location is second to none. I was in an un-renovated room and it was large - lovely and great bathroom tub. Large enough for 2 well equipped.
2786,5.0,"Great stay, bo regrets","The huge advantage is that the hotel locates in the heart of the strip. Great place to stay at. Hotel provides inroom dining. Housekeepers do their jobs. You can check in with the app and get the digital keys, saves a lot of time by skipping long waiting lines."
2787,5.0,Best Ambiance in Vegas,"Every time we come here we receive and outstanding treatment by everyone. To me is one of the best places to gamble. The atmosphere is very pleasant and you have some of the best restaurants in town right here. We have come during summer and winter, both seasons are great. During the summer I love to spend the day at the pools chilling and drinking (I recommend to everyone drink a lot of water to combat the dryness from the desert). Room services is awesome, but if the hotel is at high capacity can take long to arrive. Prices are better than expected for the service received!!"
2788,5.0,Great trip,Had a great time at Bellagio as we always do! We love to go midweek as we avoid the crowd. It’s our favorite place to stay. Rooms are classy and beds very comfortable. There’s great restaurants nearby and fun gaming. We love getting a room with a fountain view.
2789,5.0,Perfect Luxury,"We just spent 5 nights at the Bellagio and everything about it was perfection. From check in to check out, the level of customer service is just outstanding. The room is so luxurious from bed to bathroom. The bedding makes you feel like a queen. Even in February, we were able to enjoy the pool and jacuzzi, and the big pool is heated to such a perfect temperature, you could just walk in without the slightest chill, even though it was refreshing."
2790,5.0,Overnight stay,The staff was extremely friendly and the rooms are always perfect. The staff is extremely welcoming and thorough. The grounds are always top notch. I would recommend the Bellagio over many of the nearby competition.
2791,4.0,Recent stay at the Bellagio Last Vegas,"Beautiful hotel. Rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. Room was warm and the air-conditioning could have worked better. Parking is very expensive. Check in and out went smoothly. Check in staff wasn't the most friendly. Overall, it was a good experience."
2792,1.0,No bath tubs. Some idiot removed all th tubs. How can you be a luxury hotel with no bath tubs. You can't. It used,"It used to be a luxury hotel, but it no longer has bath tubs so it sucks. How could they remove what made it special. After wandering around you want to soak your tired body, but you can't. And since they close the outside hot tub n pool at 6pm it sucks. You used to be able to soak znd water h the fountain from your room, but no longer."
2793,5.0,A Great Time was had by Me!,For the most part my stay was wonderful. The hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable...Everyone! You must go to Sadelle's for breakfast/brunch...and have the brown sugar glazed 1/2 grapefruit!!! My room was very quiet.
2794,5.0,Get the app,Doing everything through the app makes staying there so easy. You can check in on it you can use your cellphone as your room key and you can also check out with it. You add amenities through your app as well.
2795,4.0,Check in process bad,"The place is nice and all but it did not start well on the check in process. I did the digital check in via the app at 3pm but the room wasn't ready so we waited for 30 minutes and there was no room number displayed on the app. I went to queue up in the long line to the lobby counter to ask for an estimation on the wait duration. The staff took down my cellphone number and told me that I will receive a call when my room is ready. We waited at the lobby floor till 4.30pm and still no calls. I had to call the front desk number from the app, speak to someone and finally at 5pm then I get a room. The whole digital check in process is a cool function to shorten the queue but it was horrible for me to stand at the lobby for 2 hours! All the other guests were given rooms after their"
2796,1.0,Be prepared to lose,"Be prepared to spend 500+ just to get a bonus and on the bonus you will win 5-30.00. The new point system is horrible for gamblers that go often. It appears to me that MGM wants to cater to people that do not gamble often so that they can take their money and it will not matter. They have lost me as a customer. The room smelled like smoke, the tub was not cleaned, the fridge was not stocked and had the previous guests drinks and food in their. Did I mention a bottle of water is $22? so after tight machines and non existent bonuses that when they do hit you get a measly 5-30 they want to charge you $22 for a bottle of water. I will leave the gambling to people that visit once a year. Since the end of the pandemic MGM has successfully made gambling no fun."
2797,5.0,One of My Favorite Hotels in The World,"I love staying at the Bellagio when I visit Las Vegas (typically during the weekend of the Super Bowl). The entire property is luxurious and the restaurants always have interesting menus with food of the highest quality. The fountain shows are a magical touch, and I always find myself stopping and enjoying a favorite song. I have travelled extensively in the US, Europe and a few trips to the Middle East and China. The Bellagio's total package just makes it a wonderful place, and I always look forward to spending time there."
2798,5.0,Excellent Stay,"I had a horrible experience at Caesar’s so I left and went to Bellagio and I’m thankful I did…complete 360… staff was great, had my information correct, room was available upon check in…earned a decent amount of tier credits."
2799,5.0,Perfect Vacation,"This was my Retirement trip my wife and I took. I have stayed in a lot of hotels on the strip and the Bellagio was the best one by far. From the Check-in process to the daily activities of interacting with the hotel staff thru Dining, the MGM awards desk and gambling the staff was always polite and friendly."
2800,5.0,This Grand Lady never gets old!,We have been going here since it opened! Always a great place and friendly folks. My only concern is that there are times when there is no place to eat lunch forcing us to move to another casino. Not a good move for folks who want to keep the gamblers in house
2801,4.0,Elegant Hotel,"My family and I were in Vegas for my son’s 40th birthday. I booked two premier rooms and expected to be upgraded but wasn’t. My renovated room was a little small, had dirty windows, overlooked roof tops, but was nicely designed. The look was subtle not over the top. Colors were relaxing and muted, and there were elegant touches throughout. The bed was comfortable. We had brunch mostly at Sadelles. We tried the buffet one morning and were shocked at how disappointing it was. Bellagio needs to bump this up as it does not compare with other luxury hotel buffets on the strip, although the coffee was really good. I had high expectations for this hotel that were not met. Staffing problems especially in the restaurants we visited were evident. The place was crowded, and staff"
2802,3.0,Room Not Cleaned Thoroughly Before Stay,"Our room was definitely not thoroughly cleaned before our stay. There was long black hair stuck on to the bathroom shower wall. The Bellagio buffet was a big let down. I'd rate their buffet a little bit better than Golden Corral. Definitely not worth the price! The main lobby, gambling areas, and location are great though!"
2803,5.0,Highly enjoyable.,"Hotel was amazing. Took someone for their first time to Vegas and the staff did everything to make it enjoyable for her. Beautifully decorated for the Chinese New Year, friendly staff throughout. Fountain view is the side to be on."
2804,5.0,Twice as nice,The Bellagio is top notch. This is my second stay in 2022 and it was as wonderful as the first stay in January. The Stay Well Resort rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The purpose of this visit was to plan a party for a friend and the staff was extremely helpful. Would highly recommend the Bellagio for your Las Vegas adventure.
2805,2.0,"Too expensive, did not provide value for the money and way too crowded","Overall the property did not provide the expected value for the money and it was way too expensive and crowded. Check in took too long and needed to stand in a line for a long time. Room was not ready until after 4:00 PM. Parking is tough to find, all gambling tables have a minimum of 25 dollars or more. Lines to get coffee or snakes are extremely long. Food in the room is very expensive. A cookie in one of the restaurant cot more than 17 dollars."
2806,1.0,"Sadly, not a great experience!","Yes, we knew it’s huge but the walk to our room, thru the smog of cigarette smoke and drunken gamblers tainted what we thought would be an elegant stay. We arrived starving late in the evening for a 10 night stay. With literally thousands of people everywhere, the only place open was ‘Snacks’ a tiny hole in the wall, another 20-30 minute walk to get to. Paid 54 dollars for a shriveled up, ice cold hot dog, a burnt hamburger and a stale slice of pizza. A real shock for the Bellagio! We sucked it up, went back to our ‘upgraded’ fountain view room which wasn’t anything special, just a plain is hotel room you’d find at any 3-4 star hotel. My husband and I kept rolling towards the middle of the bed which had sunken with zero support. A big factor was the overwhelming"
2807,5.0,Gorgeous hotel,Will definitely book again!! The room and view was amazing !!! I can't wait to go again!! The girl at front desk for check in was super sweet. Wish I remembered her name. All the staff were very helpful and sweet.
2808,1.0,5 star hotel more like a 1 star hotel,"We were excited to stay here until we went to our room and encountered 6 issues total. The issues were outrageous for a 5 star hotel such as shower knob, water pressure, bathroom’s lights, outlets’ plugs, blow dryer, and toilet."
2809,4.0,Beautiful - not really a family property,"Nice clean rooms, great staff, but lighter food or snacks are minimal, all bars (even the ones that are supposed to be chill) are very loud, and pop music playing loudly in all halls and pool. They did provide a fridge when asked - helpful. Just not very good for kids of any age."
2810,5.0,"First time at Bellagio, excellent experience","We stayed here for the first time ever after countless trips to Las Vegas. It was a great experience from the amazing room with comfortable bed to the incredible staff no matter where you were in the hotel. Higher end when it comes to gambling, so if you are not a high roller (which I am not), other casinos might be a better bet. Beautiful and clean throughout"
2811,5.0,Very nice experience. Loved that the food is very good rooms very clean and very happy with the service.,The ony thing with this trip was never seen a waitress come around to take orders to get a drink. Had to go buy it and for 9 dollars i think it would of benefit them have someone get you the drink. But all and all nice trip.
2812,5.0,Bellagio 1st Timer,"Our stay was luxury at it's best. Every staff member we encountered were welcoming, courteous and professional. The Fountain View King room...AMAZING! The only downside, no microwave for late night leftovers :)."
2813,4.0,A Perfect vacation,"Every time traveling to Las Vegas for Vacation ,the 1st thing I think is a Bellagio Casino And Hotel.It looks elegant .It is a good place to stay because it has a Beautiful Conservatory Garden , a nice room, good Buffet ,a spacious casino ,a fast drink service when playing slot machines,& a special easy parking with red and green lights that can be seen from a distance .A convenient location on the strip.I am happy to stay there.😀😀😀"
2814,3.0,bellagio,"Housekeeping needs to dust rooms before they make them available to guests who enter the hotel. Location is top of the line on the strip, great service around valet and the bars in the bellagio. Hotel needs stricter housekeeping."
2815,5.0,Awesome services!!!!!,"We have a great time and the Bellagio hotel was so interesting and beautiful, especially the water fountains. This hotel gets ten stars. I highly recommend this hotel for family and friends. Great job to all of the employees."
2816,2.0,Very expensive! Not worth it.,Although beautiful it was not worth $300 average nightly rate plus $22 for a bottled water and $65 late checkout. Prices on EVERYTHING is way over priced. Slots and table games will not pay. I played minimum on table games and lost $8k in 2 days. Dusty windows. Why wouldn't they have a window cleaning company? Pay extra for fountain view with dirty windows
2817,3.0,It was alright and we were not blown away!,"Let's face it, the building is breathtaking and so it the water show outside. However, the rooms were really basic and disappointing. We have stayed in the MGM Signature previously and their rooms were far superior to this. However, the casino is great, the restaurants in here are lovely, the staff are brilliant and so is the location."
2818,5.0,Bellagio Gorgeous Resort,The Bellagio is such a beautiful resort. We love coming here even if we don’t stay on property. We did stay on property this time and it was perfect for what we wanted to do this trip. I highly recommend this resort!
2819,5.0,Pleasant Stay,Very enjoyable. Service was excellent. Checking in was easy as everything went smoothly. The staff at the hotel was amazing. The cleanliness at the Hotel was 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend staying there.
2820,5.0,First Class,"Fabulous resort. Great casino, rooms, pools, and dining. The fountains and conservatory are the best attractions on the strip. The staff members I encountered were welcoming and helpful. Perfect location with easy walking to shopping and other nearby resorts."
2821,5.0,Fun getaway to just relax and enjoy.,"Easy check in with mobile check in, room ready and clean. Bellagio has a great location on the strip with easy access to the strip and also has the tram for easy access to the Aria or Park MGM. Nice casino floor, great food at the Buffet and good food options at the Patisserie for Coffee and snacks."
2822,4.0,Great experience minus a few room issues,Experience was great minus a room cleanliness issue which required us to be switched room. This probably wasn't as bad as my jet lagged body was feeling but it certainly was inconvenient at that time. Highly recommend the Picasso restaurant.
2823,5.0,"Beautiful hotel, great location on the Strip!","Bellagio is a top notch hotel! So beautiful, clean and such a friendly staff from concierge to restaurants and dealers! Several restaurants to choose from and a large casino. Prime Steakhouse was amazing as well! You won't be disappointed staying at Bellagio!"
2824,5.0,My birthday celebration,Everything was perfect! When we arrived the room was ready and the Champagne from our children was there ready and waiting.. We stayed 3 days and enjoyed breakfast each day and Spago on my birthday night.
2825,5.0,Excellent!,Excellent Service! All Personnel were Courteous and Friendly! Especially all my Wheelchair Escorts to my Room! Sadelles Restaurant was extra and went far and beyond to accommodate me when I was feeling ill!
2826,5.0,Fun fun,I enjoy everything the check in friendly decoration food entertainment. . I got room upgrades to water view which is so beautiful. Gaming not well lost Money had a good time . Decorating sight is beautiful
2827,2.0,Overpriced and Underdelivered,"I called before arriving to ask whether coffee makers were provided in the Suites. I was told that 'yes, they are in the rooms.' Your phone staff misinformed us. I booked (2) Two-Bedroom Tower Suites. Only 1 Suite was ""clean"" at your check-in time. The 2nd suite, after many attempts to get the adjoining room cleaned, was not delivered until around 7:30 pm. Why you would clean the main Suite and not the adjoining room I don't understand since they are offered as a 2-Room Tower Suite? The 1st Suite was not thoroughly cleaned; the bathroom carpet area was dirty and had not been vacuumed, crumbs around the floor, hair in the corners. We ordered room service. They failed to deliver the milk for the oatmeal, the butter for the bread and one of the coffees was spilled. A"
2828,2.0,Anniversary ruined,I got to belladonna at 12 noon and they didn't have a room ready until 8:30pm for me and my wife. And then for brunch the next day I went to iron are clothes and the iron leaked all over my wife's brand new dress completely destroyed it. They did bring us a brand new iron . But had to buy new clothes for her.
2829,5.0,Great weekend - NHL & NFL All-Star Games,Great place to stay with great amenities. Rooms were very well kept. Access to a variety of restaurants and shops. Has 2 Starbucks for the pick me up after the long night before. Uber & Taxi area was easy to get to.
2830,5.0,Great experience,My wife and I selected the Bellagio for Valentines and her birthday. She kept thanking me more than a few times for recommending the Bellagio hotel. We enjoyed gambling and eating at various restaurants
2831,5.0,50 Shades of Red,"Overall, this is a beautiful hotel. It's clean and this hotel is huge which makes it very spacious. The room was beautiful and the views weren't bad. I wish it was equipped with a microwave, fridge and bathtub. We were a group of 13 and we enjoyed our stay. My biggest issue is the amount of smoke when going through the casino. It's overbearing to someone who isn't a smoker."
2832,3.0,Nice stay ended with scam by the hotel,"Could have been a great stay, but we felt cheated as we checked out. The room was prepaid, but the hotel added different hotel ""fees"" as we checked out. Suddenly the price of the stay increased by 30 %. The fee was something the hotel had ""invented"", and went straight into the pocket of the hotel. What a scam!"
2833,5.0,Romantic getaway,"We left everything behind and had a fabulous romantic getaway at the Bellagio. We enjoyed the beautiful updated blue and cream color scheme. The beds were incredibly comfortable, with warm down comforter and luxury linens. It is an expensive venue, but you get what you pay for. We had an excellent time and plan to return."
2834,5.0,One of the best hotel in Vegas,"Excellent service and is one of the best hotel in Vegas. Friendly front desk reception staff. Clean room, good restaurants and splendorous lobby decoration. Nothing to complain except it's too crowded during holiday seasons."
2835,5.0,Always a great experience!,"Bellagio is always a great place to stay. The rooms are clean and the hotel is one of the best. I always enjoy Noodles, which is an Asian restaurant and Snacks, which has great turkey club sandwiches."
2836,2.0,Greedy,All this casino wants is your money. Service was terrible even if you were spending money. They always wanted more before they would serve you. I would not recommend this place to play at. I would go play at another casino instead.
2837,3.0,Bellagio-Vegas,"Don’t expect being asked if you would like a drink while in the casino. If they finally do ask, she may not come back. Happened to us several times. Worst service ever. We never received the medical refrigerator we asked for either. Had to buy a cooler. The shower took forever for hot water. Won’t be staying here again. Too expensive and we even had comp room but since it was Super bowl weekend and Valentines the price for Saturday night wasn’t comped and one night was expensive. We visit Vegas 2-3 times a year. Will stay in a different hotel next time."
2838,4.0,Beautiful Hotel and great restaurants,"The Bellagio Hotel is fantastic. Great clean modern rooms. The only issue would be that it seems most casinos allow smoking, and unfortunately to get anywhere on site you have to traverse the casino.Stinks! The fountains at bellagio are beautiful. If you book a room overlooking the fountains as we did, you need to realize the fountains run until 12AM on the hour. They make a lot of noise if you try to get to bed before then. The other consideration is the VIP lounge selection if you chose it at almost $125/day. The only advantage we saw was a more private check in and a free cup of coffee or soft drinks. I few mouthfuls of things to eat at any given time ""six individual pieces"" for whoever is there. The lounge is a few couches, nothing like you would expect from a high end"
2839,5.0,Winter getaway,It was very good. All of the employees were very nice. Our room overlooked the fountains and Vegas strip which was a great view.The room was clean and modern. The king bed was very comfortable. The patio coffee shop has great coffee and pastries.
2840,5.0,Friends,Friendly staff with outstanding service. Had a great stay and would recommend to everyone. The buffet was great and the room was clean and the cleaning staff accommodating. We also went to Sandelle’s restaurant was great to grab a light dinner
2841,5.0,Still a great place to stay,"Always a lovely stay. The hotel is in a fabulous location, has consistently great service, and remains clean and beautiful. Even the room service food is delicious. Michael Mina in the conservatory is a standout option for dinner."
2842,5.0,Simply Amazing,"You just can't go wrong here...its the only place I want to stay at when visiting Vegas. Its elegant, super clean in the center of the strip, everything you need is there. The staff is super friendly and extremely helpful."
2843,5.0,Pure class,Great service great food just pure class Prime steakhouse was just delicious Check in by phone was really easy I had a question about a charge the desk woman was very understanding Hand oats at slots were prompt
2844,5.0,Love the Bellagio!,This is our second time staying at the Bellagio and we loved it once again. The staff is amazing and the property is beautiful. We ate at PRIME & Sadelle's while there and would recommend both! The fitness center is one of the best I've seen at a hotel with tons of equipment. The location of the hotel is perfect!
2845,4.0,Had trouble get the room I booked,We arrived on Friday in the evening. The king suite we booked months ago was given to someone else so we had to stay in a double queen room. Had to request multiple times to change to the right one. Kind of annoying.
2846,2.0,Disappointed,"Romantic getaway for me and my wife. We both work demanding jobs and I feel that we was overlooked and not like a gold member at all. I was disappointed about the treatment received. I’m trying to wrap my head around the situation, to just assume it was just super bowl weekend."
2847,4.0,Bellagio was a “B”,"We celebrated a birthday here for a 4-night stay and enjoyed our stay, but for the price, we wish we would have stayed elsewhere. BUT we appreciated the friendly and professional staff!! It was nice to have the amenities we had (restaurants, spa, and pool/hot tub) and be so centrally located on the strip!"
2848,5.0,Birthday week,"Had a great time! Not a winner but enjoyed my stay! Double check your door, 2nd day realized my door wasn’t locking, friend had adjoining room so would go in n out that way. Did notify front desk upon leaving."
2849,5.0,Happy Valentine!,"We had a great time watching the fountain show from our room, dining at Prime and a drink afterwards at your lounge. Your singer on Valentine's night was great. Overall the experience was great and the overall cleanliness was appreciated"
2850,2.0,Noisy water view rooms,"You can clearly hear music from the Drai nightclub across the street until 3 am if you pay extra to stay in a water view room. Not sure what the hotel can do, but not cool. They don’t tell you this when you book for obvious reasons. Have fun with the techno sirens in your room while you gaze at the fountain."
2851,5.0,Amazing service from ERIC COOPER @ the Concierge desk.,"We received excellent service from Eric Cooper at the Concierge desk, he gave us his undivided attention and helped us book the shows we wanted to see. We received the best seats for an amazing experience here in Vegas . He took the time to go over all our options Without rushing us . Many rude people tried to get his attention and ask him questions while he was helping us and not once did he stray his attention from us, he politely told them to wait their turn. He was very professional and kept apologizing for the other guests rudely interpreting. Quality service from a 5 star employee at the Famous Bellagio Hotel. Ask for Eric when you are looking for amazing customer service . Thank you again Eric .. YOU ROCK !!!!"
2852,5.0,Our first trip to Vegas was like hitting the Jackpot at the Bellagio,Staying at the Bellagio was the BEST decision we made. The property is so beautiful and our stay was AMAZING!!!! The rooms are so comforting. There is so much to see just inside the hotel. The restaurants were delicious!!!!
2853,4.0,Loved the view,Beautiful hotel staff was a little stand-offish but that could be due to the continuous check-in process over and over every day. Was a overall fun trip. “O” show was amazing and very close to vegas strip
2854,5.0,Top-notch hotel,"The Bellagio is a top-notch hotel in Las Vegas. The staff are pleasant, professional and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and the amenities are excellent. The Petrossian Bar is the lobby is a great addition - we will definitely stay at The Bellagio again."
2855,5.0,Perfection,Loved every minute of staying here. The stay well fountain king room was so comfortable It was hard for me to leave! The view we had of the fountains was magnificent. Whoever thought of that idea is a genius. I cannot wait to go back.
2856,4.0,"Great Place, Ask for an Updated Room","We love the Bellagio, but we learned on this trip to ask for an updated room next time. Also, do not eat at Yellowtail. It’s so overpriced and not good at all. Definitely try the Mayfair Supper Club. The food, service, and entertainment was fabulous!"
2857,5.0,Fantastic stay at Bellagio,"Such a great stay. I’d highly recommend for a long weekend. The amenities and staff were just QUALITY. We’ll be coming back. Soon. Far exceeded fairly high expectations. Food, gaming and staff were excellent. And the bonus … great location on the strip. Book your trip!"
2858,2.0,Disappointed,Got put in a smoking room and I don’t smoke and the bathroom had mold in it. I wiped it down myself. Normally everything is great but this room wasn’t the best but I paid a lot of money to stay there.
2859,5.0,The best resort on the Strip,"Compared with all the other resorts on the strip, the Bellagio decor is timeless. I’ve been to Rome, Venice, Paris, New York and the resorts that pretend to emulate those cities don’t come close. The Bellagio’s style is timeless"
2860,5.0,First time stay,Me and my wife went to Vegas for our 20th anniversary it was our first time there everything was really really wonderful I didn’t even mind paying $12 for a bag of chips The bellman did a tremendous job referring us to various places to eat
2861,5.0,You Won't Go Wrong at the Bellagio,"We live in Vegas but from time to time do a ""staycation"". We chose the Bellagio this time and had an absolute blast! It is Chinese New Year so the decor was spectacular. The dining was incredible and the staff and rooms we on point. We will be coming back for sure!"
2862,5.0,Nice,"The Bellagio is a great hotel with awesome options for eating. The rooms were clean and an exceptional staff. I ate at the Bellagio buffet and it really surprised me with the quality of the of service and food. Prices are a bit higher than other places but I believe sometimes you pay for what you get, and my stay was worth every penny."
2863,5.0,Stay at Bellagio,We had a long awaited trip to Las Vegas last week. Staying at Bellagio’s was a pleasure. Every staff member we encounter was helpful and pleasant. We found the facility extremely clean and well kept. The restaurants were excellent.
2864,5.0,Worth the price,I've always wanted to stay here and it finally happened. It is a top of the line property. Excellent rooms. Very pricey for everything here so plan accordingly. We saw 'O' the cirque show and it was amazing. Did not eat anywhere on property due to the cost. Would stay again.
2865,5.0,A must see Hotel!,The Botanical Garden is a must see the Bellagio Hotel! Besides everything that you need is inside the hotel! There’s no need to leave the hotel for anything else! I already plan to go back there soon!
2866,5.0,Always classy and wonderful,"Bellagio is a wonderful spot to stay in Vegas- location wonderful and having a room with a view of the fountains is a must! friendly staff, lovely restaurants and shopping... the pool is fabulous and lobby decor beautiful. highly recommend"
2867,4.0,"Fine Stay, nothing truly exceptional","No coffee or tea in the guest rooms, limited lunch options in the hotel There was no additional set up or multiple options to watch the Super Bowl on site. The Conservatory was absolutely stunning for the Lunar New Year."
2868,2.0,Come for the fountains and beauty - but that's about it,"HEAR ME OUT.. please! Is this hotel amazing with all of the grandeur of their art, decorations, jaw-dropping architecture and beautiful amenities...YES! However, it all depends on what you are looking for when you stay here. Yes, they have a great sports book if that is what you are looking for. Yes, they have great restaurants (Jasmine and Petrossian are both favorites of mine). Yes, the amount of beauty you will see here and take pictures of is plenty. HOWEVER - IF THE ROOMS are what you are looking for, then I would say perhaps it is time to look elsewhere. Now, I have been staying here consistently on every visit for probably the past 10 years (I come 2-4 times a year). I think what this hotel really needs is a HUGE room makeover. Now, don't get me wrong, the rooms"
2869,5.0,OMG the POOL!,"Everyone knows the Bellagio for it's fountains (amazing) but did you know they have beautiful swimming pools, too?! AND the rooms decorated SO beautifully (made Best Western feel like a let down in comparison)."
2870,2.0,Hot rooms even in February,Could not get the rooms below 70 degrees till about 2 am. Automated checkout not working never received itemized bill etc. just too big and busy. Smoking situation in the casino is not good lists of us would have runny eyes for the first hour don stairs day or night.
2871,3.0,Rooms need updating and lots of maintenance,"Rooms need updating and lots of maintenance. Tv's didn't work, steamer in shower didn't work, carpet tore apart all over the place, fridge wasn't stocked properly and door didn't stay shut. Just really in desperate need of updating. Stayed in the parlor suite with the pool table. A lot of money for a gross room. View of tram... not impressed."
2872,5.0,Beautiful trip,"We had a short but fun experience and staying at this hotel was perfect. We felt safe food was amazing, and O was amazing show and well worth my money then largo after the show was perfect … gambling was sad and food was expensive but we had a good time"
2873,5.0,Obsessed with this resort!,Will only stay at the Bellagio from now on while is Vegas!! We were very impressed from the bell gentleman to the sweetest lady that cleaned of room. Truly enjoyed our stay! Can’t wait to visit again.
2874,5.0,The place to stay in Vegas,We stayed at the Bellagio while attending the ProBowl. Large room with a fantastic view of the fountains and Vegas. Large modern bathroom. Located in the heart of the attractions. Staff was super friendly.
2875,5.0,Excellent choice for our stay!,"The Bellagio was beautiful and so were the people who serve their guests! Our room was very comfortable and the view was amazing. Enjoyed watching the fountain and the view of the strip. Room service was prompt and the food was not only delicious, but reasonable considering what we would have paid at a Vegas restaurant."
2876,3.0,Good but not great!,"We've stayed at Belliagio before. This time, the room felt dated. The water pressure in the shower was not good. We had a gurgling sound and a sewage smell coming out of our sinks. My wife opened a bottle of water - $22. Not sure I'll be coming back to Bellagio."
2877,2.0,Unsatisfied,"There was trash in the room when we checked in and the wall was dirty. We contacted the front desk to take care of it, they said they will send someone to take care of the incident but no one came to do so."
2878,5.0,Extraordinary experience. This is the only place we stay when we visit Las Vegas,The hotel is extremely clean and staff is very friendly. We love to stay at Bellagio!! It was a busy weekend but the staff kept up well. You could use more staff at Mylife service desk had to wait in line several minutes with only 2 customer service agents working.
2879,5.0,Valentines Retreat with my Valentine.,We started the evening with George Strait followed by a great night sleep in a super comfortable bed. Next morning enjoyed the 5star spa treatment indulging in the couples massage with Tranquility Pool Get-Away. That night we took in Cirque Du Soleil that was fantastic! Great food and top notch service. A 1-stop-shop for a 1st class experience.
2880,2.0,Half the room didn’t work. Woke up hot sweaty at night and cold showers.,"Room was terrible. Air conditioner didn’t work, hot water don’ didn’t work in shower only in tub. Blinds wouldn’t open. Lady at front desk said she couldn’t comp us anything. Last place I will stay again and this was our honeymoon. Terrible room and really didn’t care how she wouldn’t comp us anything. I talked to plenty of people that they helped out. Motel 6 would have better at this point."
2881,5.0,"Perfect location, Great quality",The location was superb! Centrally located along the Las Vegas strip. Fine dining and shopping available at the hotel. Clean rooms with super comfy beds. Would definitely stay here again and again and again!
2882,1.0,"Dirty rooms at checkin, TWICE. Waisted 45 min of nonsense trying to get into a clean room.","I booked.a Premium Double Queen for business (which cost more than the standard) and was highly disappointed with my check-in process. It took three times to get into a room that has been cleaned, and this was at 7pm. As anyone who’s been to Vegas, it’s always a long walk to get to your hotel room (with luggage on top of it all!). First room: upon arrival, the door was ajar. Bad sign. Pushed the door open and there was trash left by the previous guest everywhere, dirty room, and I tried calling the front desk. No one can help. Bolted back to the lobby, complained and they gave me another room. Second room: unbelievably, it was also not cleaned, with towels on the floor, dirty bathroom, and messy bed sheets. So gross. Bolted out of there. Pissed. Went all the way back to the"
2883,1.0,Party in next room and no resolution given!,Paid for a stay well suite. Advertised as spa style for relaxation and better sleep. Room was fine but room next door was having a party. Called for resolution multiple times with nothing. Finally after two hours called and asked for another room. It was given with no apologies or help with our luggage.
2884,5.0,Great place to stay,The Bellagio is still the classiest hotel in Las Vegas. it looks as good as when it was built. Restaurants are a class act and the Casino is well maintained with excellent service. Staff at all locations were ready to serve efficiently and with a smile.
2885,4.0,Housekeeping,"I extended my check in til 3. House keeping knocked on my door three times, which made my extended stay not worth it, I had to get up every time they knocked, telling them all the same thing, they interrupted my sleep, communication was off"
2886,4.0,"Great Experience, But Be Prepared.....","Awesome room, but lack of in room coffee maker (forcing you to go down and pay for a $12 coffee) and the hyper sensitive fridge which charges you for anything you move but not consume (in order to chill your own soft drinks) which caused an excessive charge at check out--both of which are 1st world problems--made it a lesser high-end experience than one would want for the kind of coin being spent by folks who were ""splurging"" for an anniversary trip to get a high end room. But not get gigged every time you turned around should be considered a high end experience as well"
2887,3.0,Nice stay,Family vacation. Rooms could have been nicer - cleaner. Tables were not wiped down properly. Toothpaste from prior guest left in our sink. Garbage at our door when we checked in. Was disturbed 2 times to see if we were ready to leave.
2888,3.0,Would not stay here again,"I actually had us booked for Treasure Island at first and wanted to upgrade our hotel stay. I have been to Vegas whereas my family has not and Bellagio was the top of the line when I was there before. As far as elegance and aesthetics, Bellagio is gorgeous! Hotel lobby and gambling areas are very nice to look at. However, that's where it all seems to stop. I am writing this as a person who has always had nice things, but I don't drive a Mercedes, live in a gated community, or ride first class unless I'm freely upgraded lol. There is no convenience here. My mom found a shop at the end of our stay and maybe that's on us, but most hotels have a very visible convenience shop for drinks, snacks, toiletries, etc. There are not many normal, fun restaurants here. No place really to get"
